# Documentation-Based Programming Security

This document outlines the security considerations, architecture, and principles of the Documentation-Based Programming system.

## Core Security Principles

- **Data Locality**: All processing performed locally, no data leaves the system
- **Isolation**: Complete separation between indexed projects
- **No Code Execution**: System never executes arbitrary code
- **Controlled Modifications**: Recommendations require explicit developer approval
- **Resource Constraints**: <5% CPU and <100MB RAM with intelligent throttling
- **Access Control**: Follows existing filesystem permissions
- **Persistence Protection**: SQLite database protected by file system permissions

## Security Architecture

The Documentation-Based Programming system is designed with a security-first mindset, ensuring it cannot be used as an attack vector:

1. **Local Processing Only**: All data processing occurs entirely on the user's local machine
2. **Zero External Transmission**: No code or metadata is ever transmitted to external servers
3. **Network Isolation**: The system operates purely within the local environment with no outbound connections
4. **Default Network Binding**: By default, the product binds on address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) for enhanced security
   - **Rationale**: Restricting network binding to localhost prevents external network access, protecting the service from unauthorized access and potential network-based attacks
   - **Implementation**: All network services default to localhost binding unless explicitly configured otherwise
   - **Benefits**: Enhanced security posture by default, prevents accidental exposure to wider networks
4. **User Control**: All recommendations are presented for explicit developer approval
5. **Resource Monitoring**: The system limits its resource consumption and implements throttling during high system load
6. **Custom Code Restriction**: The system cannot execute arbitrary code supplied by users or metadata
7. **Storage Protection**: The metadata SQLite database is protected by filesystem permissions

## Data Privacy Considerations

- **Source Code Privacy**: No project code ever leaves the local environment
- **Metadata Protection**: All extracted metadata remains under developer control
- **Permissions Preservation**: The system cannot bypass existing filesystem access controls
- **Data Minimization**: Only extracts metadata necessary for recommendations
- **Cleanup Process**: Deleting project directories removes all associated metadata

## Security in the Documentation Monitoring Component

The Documentation Monitoring component implements these security measures:

- **Selective Indexing**: Only indexes text-based files, ignoring binaries and sensitive files
- **Processing Isolation**: Each project is completely isolated from others
- **Path Validation**: Strict validation of all file paths to prevent path traversal
- **Resource Throttling**: Automatic throttling when system load is high
- **Event Debouncing**: Intelligent handling of rapid file changes to prevent resource spikes

## Security in Recommendation Processing

The recommendation system implements these security controls:

- **No Auto-Implementation**: Never automatically applies changes without developer approval
- **Decision Logging**: Maintains audit log of all recommendation decisions
- **Content Validation**: All recommendation content is validated before presentation
- **Developer Control**: Multiple decision options (ACCEPT/REJECT/AMEND) for complete control
- **Limited Scope**: Recommendations cannot affect files outside the project directory

## Security in MCP Client and Server Implementation

The MCP implementation follows these security principles:

### MCP Server
- **Local Server**: Runs locally with no external connections
- **Limited Scope**: Only provides services within defined tool boundaries
- **Resource Monitoring**: Implements resource limits and usage monitoring
- **Command Validation**: All commands validated before execution
- **Error Containment**: Robust error handling to prevent any system impact

### MCP Client
- **No External Credentials Required**: Python MCP client does not require AWS credentials
  - **Rationale**: Client only communicates with MCP server using the MCP protocol, not directly with AWS services
  - **Implementation**: Credential management remains server-side responsibility only
- **Protocol Security**: Communicates with MCP server using the MCP protocol only
- **Credential Separation**: All credential management remains server-side
- **Clear Scope Boundaries**: Client handles communication but delegates processing to server

This comprehensive security model ensures that the Documentation-Based Programming system maintains the confidentiality and integrity of all project code and documentation while operating with minimal system impact.

## Security Verification

The security of the system can be verified through:

1. Network traffic monitoring (should show no external connections)
2. Resource usage monitoring (should remain below defined thresholds)
3. File access monitoring (should only access project files)
4. Permission testing (should respect file system permissions)
5. Execution monitoring (should never execute arbitrary code)

## Relationship to Other Components

- Complies with all security requirements in DESIGN.md
- Implements data protection measures described in DATA_MODEL.md
- Follows resource constraints specified in WORKING_BACKWARDS.md
