# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: design

## Directory Purpose
The doc/design directory contains detailed design documents for specific architectural components and subsystems of the Documentation-Based Programming platform. These documents provide in-depth technical specifications, design rationales, and implementation guidance for key system components beyond what is covered in the high-level architectural documentation. Each document focuses on a particular system feature or component, providing developers with the detailed context needed for implementation while ensuring alignment with the overall system architecture defined in the main design documents.
