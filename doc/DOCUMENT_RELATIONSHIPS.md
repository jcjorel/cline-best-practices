# Documentation Relationships

This document maps the relationships between documentation files in the project. It serves as a central registry for tracking dependencies and impacts between documentation files, enabling the system to maintain global consistency.

## Code Analysis Documentation Relationships

- **DESIGN.md** contains the high-level approach to using Claude 3.7 Sonnet for code analysis
- **DATA_MODEL.md** defines the structure of metadata extracted by Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## Relationship Types

- **Depends on**: Document A depends on information in Document B. Changes to Document B may require updates to Document A.
- **Impacts**: Document A contains information that may affect Document B. Changes to Document A may require updates to Document B.

## Core Documentation

## DESIGN_DECISIONS.md
- Depends on: None
- Impacts: [DESIGN.md](#designmd) - Topic: Design decisions - Scope: Project-wide architectural choices (temporarily empty - decisions merged)
- Impacts: [DATA_MODEL.md](#data_modelmd) - Topic: Design decisions - Scope: Data handling approaches (temporarily empty - decisions merged)

## DESIGN.md
- Depends on: None
- Impacts: [DATA_MODEL.md](#data_modelmd) - Topic: System architecture - Scope: Entire system design
- Impacts: [DATA_MODEL.md](#data_modelmd) - Topic: Security considerations - Scope: Data protection and access controls
- Impacts: [DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md](#document_relationshipsmd) - Topic: Documentation structure - Scope: File structure and workflow

## DATA_MODEL.md

## Recommendation Templates

## Recommendation Files
- Depends on: [DATA_MODEL.md](#data_modelmd) - Topic: Recommendation structure - Scope: File format and data fields
- Impacts: None

## Update Workflow

When documentation files are updated:

1. Check this document to identify all related documents that may be impacted
2. Review the identified documents for potential inconsistencies
3. Update this document if new relationships are identified or existing relationships change

## Relationship Management Guidelines

1. **Specificity**: Make relationship topics as specific as possible to aid in impact analysis
2. **Completeness**: Ensure all meaningful relationships are captured
3. **Bidirectionality**: Every "Depends on" should have a corresponding "Impacts" in the target document
4. **Minimalism**: Only record relationships that provide meaningful information for maintaining consistency

## Relationship Graph

The documentation relationship graph forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the following characteristics:

- **DESIGN_DECISIONS.md**: Root node with potential future outgoing edges as new decisions are added
- **DESIGN.md**: Root node with outgoing edges to DATA_MODEL.md and DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md
- **PR-FAQ.md**: Root node with outgoing edge to WORKING_BACKWARDS.md
- **DATA_MODEL.md**: Leaf node with incoming edges from DESIGN.md
- **DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md**: Leaf node with incoming edge from DESIGN.md
- **WORKING_BACKWARDS.md**: Leaf node with incoming edge from PR-FAQ.md

This graph structure helps the system determine the correct order for propagating updates and ensuring global consistency.
