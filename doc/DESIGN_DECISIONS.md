# Design Decisions

This document serves as a temporary log of project-wide design decisions that have not yet been incorporated into the appropriate documentation files. Decisions are recorded with newest entries at the top and should be periodically synced to appropriate documentation files (DESIGN.md, SECURITY.md, DATA_MODEL.md, CONFIGURATION.md).

<!-- No pending design decisions at this moment. All decisions have been successfully incorporated into the appropriate documentation files. -->
