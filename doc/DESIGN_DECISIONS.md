# Design Decisions

This document serves as a temporary log of project-wide design decisions that have not yet been incorporated into the appropriate documentation files. Decisions are recorded with newest entries at the top and should be periodically synced to appropriate documentation files (DESIGN.md, SECURITY.md, DATA_MODEL.md, CONFIGURATION.md).

## Decision: Process Only One Codebase File at a Time During Background Tasks

**Date**: 2025-04-13

**Decision**: During background tasks, the system will process only one codebase file at a time.

**Rationale**: 
- Ensures consistent and predictable system resource usage
- Prevents resource spikes that could impact developer experience
- Simplifies debugging and progress tracking
- Enables more accurate error isolation when processing fails
- Allows for cleaner implementation of the processing queue

**Alternatives considered**:
- Batch processing multiple files: Rejected due to unpredictable resource consumption and complexity in error handling
- Dynamic file count based on system resources: Rejected due to inconsistent behavior across environments and added complexity
- Parallel processing with worker pool: Rejected due to potential race conditions and increased complexity without significant performance benefits

**Implications**:
- Processing large codebases will take longer as files are processed sequentially
- System must implement effective prioritization to ensure critical files are processed first
- Progress indicators should clearly show queue position and estimated completion time
- Throttling mechanism may still be needed to control processing speed
