# Design Decisions

This document tracks new design decisions that haven't yet been integrated into the core documentation files. Once integrated, decisions are removed from this file and merged into the appropriate core documentation.

Note: This file is currently empty because all previous design decisions have been successfully integrated into the core documentation files (DESIGN.md, DATA_MODEL.md, CONFIGURATION.md, etc.).
