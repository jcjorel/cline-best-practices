# Design Decisions

This document serves as a temporary log of project-wide design decisions that have not yet been incorporated into the appropriate documentation files. Decisions are recorded with newest entries at the top and should be periodically synced to appropriate documentation files (DESIGN.md, SECURITY.md, DATA_MODEL.md, CONFIGURATION.md).

There are currently no pending design decisions to be merged. All previously recorded decisions have been successfully incorporated into the appropriate documentation files:

- Database Architecture → DATA_MODEL.md
- Configuration Strategy → CONFIGURATION.md
- Recommendation Lifecycle Management → DATA_MODEL.md 
- Code Structure Governance → DESIGN.md
- LLM Processing Approach → DESIGN.md
- Prompt Template Management → design/INTERNAL_LLM_TOOLS.md
- Enhanced Metadata Extraction → DATA_MODEL.md
- MCP Client Security → SECURITY.md
- Implementation Principles → DESIGN.md

The last integration was completed on 2025-04-14T19:25:00Z.
