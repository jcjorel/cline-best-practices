# Documentation-Based Programming System Architecture

This document describes the architectural principles, components, and design decisions for the Documentation-Based Programming system, which treats documentation as the single source of truth in a project.

## Code Analysis Approach

1. **Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Based Analysis**: The system uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet LLM to analyze codebase files and extract metadata.
2. **Metadata Extraction Capabilities**:
   - Extract header sections from source files
   - Retrieve function lists with associated documentation sections
   - Determine file coding language
3. **Analysis Method**: Claude's natural language understanding is used to perform semantic analysis of code structures without relying on keyword-based parsing.
4. **Parsing Prohibition**: Keyword-based parsing will never be used in any part of the application.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Documentation as Source of Truth**: Documentation takes precedence over code itself for understanding project intent.
2. **Automatic Consistency Maintenance**: System actively ensures consistency between documentation and code.
3. **Global Contextual Awareness**: AI assistants maintain awareness of entire project context.
4. **Design Decision Preservation**: All significant design decisions are captured and maintained.
5. **Zero Configuration Operation**: System functions without requiring manual setup or maintenance.

## System Components

### 1. Documentation Monitoring

- **Component Purpose**: Detect changes in documentation and code files
- **Implementation Strategy**: Lightweight file system watcher with debounced updates
- **Performance Constraints**: <5% CPU and <100MB RAM usage
- **Response Time**: All changes detected within 10 seconds

### 2. Consistency Analysis Engine

- **Component Purpose**: Analyze relationships between documentation and code
- **Implementation Strategy**: In-memory graph representation of document relationships
- **Analysis Types**:
  - Documentation-to-documentation consistency
  - Documentation-to-code alignment
  - Code-to-documentation impact analysis
- **Processing Strategy**: Background incremental processing with priority queuing

### 3. Recommendation Generator

- **Component Purpose**: Create actionable recommendations to maintain documentation consistency
- **Implementation Strategy**: Template-based recommendation generation with contextual awareness
- **Recommendation Types**:
  - Documentation updates based on code changes
  - Code refactoring to align with documentation
  - Inconsistency resolution between documentation files
- **File Management**: FIFO queue of individual recommendation files

### 4. Developer Feedback System

- **Component Purpose**: Capture and process developer decisions on recommendations
- **Implementation Strategy**: File-based feedback mechanism with ACCEPT/REJECT/AMEND options
- **Processing Logic**: Immediate response to feedback file changes
- **Amendment Handling**: Regeneration of recommendations based on developer guidance

```

## Recommendation Workflow

1. **Detection**: System detects documentation or code changes
2. **Analysis**: Changes analyzed for consistency impacts
3. **Generation**: Recommendation file created in `recommendations/` directory
4. **Prioritization**: Oldest recommendation moved to `PENDING_RECOMMENDATION.md`
5. **Developer Review**: Developer reviews and sets ACCEPT/REJECT/AMEND
6. **Processing**: System processes the developer decision:
   - ACCEPT: Implements recommendation automatically
   - REJECT: Removes recommendation from queue
   - AMEND: Regenerates recommendation with developer feedback

## Security and Data Handling

- **Data Locality**: All processing performed locally, no data leaves the system
- **Isolation**: Complete separation between indexed projects
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent throttling during high system load
- **Persistence**: Pure in-memory operation with no database requirements

## Out of Scope

- **Code Execution**: System does not execute code on developer's behalf
- **Security Testing**: No security vulnerability scanning capability
- **Performance Profiling**: No code performance analysis
- **External Integration**: No integrations with external systems/APIs

## Design Decisions

### Decision: FIFO Recommendation Queue

**Decision**: Implement a First-In-First-Out queue for recommendation processing.

**Rationale**: The FIFO approach ensures that older recommendations are addressed before newer ones, preventing recommendation buildup and ensuring that fundamental issues are resolved before addressing their downstream effects.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Priority-based queue: Rejected due to complexity in accurately determining recommendation importance.
- Direct application: Rejected to ensure developer maintains final control over all changes.

**Implications**: Developers must process recommendations in the order presented, but can use AMEND to adjust inappropriate recommendations.

### Decision: File-Based Feedback Mechanism

**Decision**: Use file modifications as the primary feedback mechanism.

**Rationale**: File-based approach integrates seamlessly with existing developer workflows and version control systems without requiring additional UI components.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Interactive CLI: Rejected due to disruption of developer workflow.
- Custom UI: Rejected to maintain terminal-first philosophy of Cline.

**Implications**: All recommendation interactions visible in version control history, creating an audit trail of documentation decisions.

## Relationship to Other Components

- Integrates with Cline's context management
- Complements MCP Server architecture
- Enhances Anthropic Claude prompt effectiveness
