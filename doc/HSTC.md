# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: doc

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. It follows the DBP methodology with structured markdown files that define the system architecture, APIs, configuration options, data models, security considerations, and other important aspects of the system. The documentation serves as a single source of truth for the project and is designed to maintain consistency with the codebase through automated analysis and tracking of relationships between documentation files.

## Child Directories

### llm
This directory contains components related to llm.

### design
This directory contains components related to design.
