# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: doc

## Directory Purpose
The doc directory serves as the authoritative source of documentation for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It contains the core architectural documentation, design principles, data models, API specifications, security considerations, and other technical references that govern the system's implementation. This directory follows a structured approach to documentation with clear relationships between documents, versioning of design decisions, and separation of concerns. The documentation here is considered the single source of truth for architectural and design decisions, establishing the standards and patterns that the implementation must follow.

## Child Directories

### design
Contains detailed design documents for specific architectural components and subsystems, providing in-depth technical specifications beyond what is covered in the high-level architectural documentation.

### llm
Contains documentation related to Language Model (LLM) components, including prompt templates, usage guidelines, and best practices for working with LLMs within the system.
