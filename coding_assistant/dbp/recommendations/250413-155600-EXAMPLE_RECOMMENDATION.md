## Recommendation: UPDATE_DESIGN_DOCUMENT_WITH_SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS

**Created**: 2025-04-13 15:56:00
**Priority**: Medium

### Detected Inconsistency

The PR-FAQ.md document mentions "security considerations" in the Questions and Answers section, but the DESIGN.md document does not contain a dedicated section for security considerations. This inconsistency may lead to confusion about how security is handled in the system.

### Affected Files

- `doc/DESIGN.md`
- `doc/PR-FAQ.md`

### Suggested Changes

#### In `doc/DESIGN.md`:

```diff
## Out of Scope

- **Code Execution**: System does not execute code on developer's behalf
- **Security Testing**: No security vulnerability scanning capability
- **Performance Profiling**: No code performance analysis
- **External Integration**: No integrations with external systems/APIs

+## Security Considerations
+
+- **Data Protection**: All data processed locally, never transmitted externally
+- **Isolation**: Complete separation between indexed projects
+- **No Code Execution**: System never executes arbitrary code
+- **No System Modifications**: Recommendations require explicit developer approval
+- **Access Control**: Follows existing filesystem permissions
+
+The system is designed with a security-first mindset, ensuring that it cannot be used as an attack vector. It operates entirely within the user's environment, with no external communication channels that could be exploited.

## Design Decisions
```

### Rationale

Adding a dedicated Security Considerations section to the DESIGN.md document will:

1. Ensure consistency with the PR-FAQ document which mentions security aspects
2. Make security considerations explicit and centralized
3. Provide clear guidance on the security boundaries of the system
4. Help developers understand the security implications of the system

This change aligns the DESIGN.md document with the security information mentioned in the PR-FAQ.md document, maintaining documentation consistency across the project.
