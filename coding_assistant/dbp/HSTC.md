# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: dbp

## Directory Purpose
The coding_assistant/dbp directory contains resources and tools related to the Documentation-Based Programming system that are specifically designed for integration with the coding assistant. This directory serves as a bridge between the main DBP system and the coding assistant functionality, providing dedicated databases, recommendation storage, and other support resources. It functions as a workspace for the coding assistant to store and retrieve information needed for providing assistance to users while working with the Documentation-Based Programming system.

## Local Files

### `database.db`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  SQLite database file used by the coding assistant for storing metadata, recommendations, and analysis results related to the Documentation-Based Programming system.

  - Persistent storage for coding assistant operations
  - Structured data organization for recommendations and analysis
  - Local database for improved performance
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Must maintain schema compatibility with the main DBP database
  - File-based database for easy deployment
