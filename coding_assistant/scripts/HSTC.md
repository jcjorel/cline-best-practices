# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: scripts

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains utility scripts that support the maintenance and operation of the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. Scripts focus on automation of routine tasks, diagnostic operations, and system maintenance procedures. The scripts implement standalone functionality that can be executed independently from the main application, particularly focusing on HSTC (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context) management to maintain documentation integrity throughout the project.

### `identify_hstc_updates.py`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  Identifies directories that require HSTC.md file updates or creation based on project requirements.
  This script helps maintain the Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context by finding directories that:
  1. Contain HSTC_REQUIRES_UPDATE.md files (indicating pending updates)
  2. Do not contain HSTC.md files (indicating missing HSTC documentation)
  The script respects .gitignore patterns to avoid processing ignored files and directories.
  
source_file_design_principles: |
  - Single responsibility: Focus solely on identifying directories needing HSTC updates
  - Non-destructive: Read-only operations, no modifications to filesystem
  - Respect project configuration: Honor .gitignore patterns
  - Prioritize by complexity: Sort results by path length to handle more complex directories first
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Must work on Unix-like and Windows systems
  - Should handle large directory structures efficiently
  - Must parse and respect all .gitignore files in the directory tree
