# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: coding_assistant

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains tools, utilities, and scripts that support the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system, primarily focused on integration with AI coding assistants. It includes templates for code documentation, logging infrastructure, database support files, and utility scripts for HSTC management and other maintenance tasks. The components in this directory enhance developer productivity by automating routine tasks and maintaining documentation consistency.

## Child Directories

### dbp
This directory contains components related to dbp, including pending recommendation storage and tracking functionality.

### logs
This directory contains components related to logs.

### scripts
This directory contains utility scripts that support the maintenance and operation of the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. Scripts focus on automation of routine tasks, diagnostic operations, and system maintenance procedures. The scripts implement standalone functionality that can be executed independently from the main application, particularly focusing on HSTC (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context) management to maintain documentation integrity throughout the project.
