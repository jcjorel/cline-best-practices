# File System Monitor Redesign Implementation Plan

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: CODING ASSISTANT MUST READ THESE DOCUMENTATION FILES COMPLETELY BEFORE EXECUTING ANY TASKS IN THIS PLAN

## Documentation References

- [Design](../../doc/DESIGN.md) - Core architectural principles and design decisions
- [Configuration](../../doc/CONFIGURATION.md) - Configuration options for the fs_monitor component

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps required to redesign the fs_monitor component according to the specifications in the design document. The redesign will replace the current implementation with a more efficient, flexible, and feature-rich file system monitoring system.

### Key Changes

1. **Remove dependency on change_queue component**
   - The fs_monitor component will no longer rely on the change_queue component
   - Event dispatching will be handled internally by the fs_monitor component

2. **Direct dependency on config_manager**
   - The fs_monitor component will depend directly on the config_manager component
   - Configuration options will be accessed through the config_manager

3. **Listener-based architecture**
   - Implement a registration API for file system event listeners
   - Define an abstract listener class with methods for different event types
   - Support for file, directory, and symlink events

4. **Resource optimization**
   - Ensure only one OS-level watch per resource
   - Implement reference counting for watched resources
   - Support for debounced event notifications

5. **Enhanced path handling**
   - Support for both absolute and Git root-relative paths
   - Unix-like wildcard pattern matching
   - Symlink resolution and tracking

## Implementation Phases

The implementation will be divided into the following phases:

1. **Core Abstractions**
   - Define the abstract listener class
   - Implement the watch handle class
   - Create exceptions and utility functions

2. **Watch Management**
   - Implement the watch manager
   - Develop path resolution and pattern matching
   - Create the internal resource tracking system

3. **Event Dispatching**
   - Implement the event dispatcher
   - Create the debouncing mechanism
   - Develop the thread management system

4. **Platform-Specific Implementations**
   - Implement Linux (inotify) monitor
   - Implement macOS (FSEvents) monitor
   - Implement Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW) monitor
   - Create fallback polling monitor

5. **Component Integration**
   - Update the component class
   - Implement configuration handling
   - Create initialization and shutdown logic
   - Remove change_queue dependency

6. **Testing and Validation**
   - Create unit tests for each component
   - Develop integration tests
   - Perform cross-platform validation

## Implementation Considerations

### Backward Compatibility

The redesigned fs_monitor component will not be backward compatible with code that directly uses the change_queue component. A migration guide is provided in the design document to help users update their code to use the new listener-based API.

### Performance Optimization

The implementation will focus on optimizing performance in the following areas:

1. **Resource Usage**
   - Minimize the number of OS-level watches
   - Implement efficient path matching algorithms
   - Use lazy initialization for resources

2. **Concurrency**
   - Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
   - Dedicated thread for event dispatching
   - Proper synchronization for shared resources

3. **Memory Management**
   - Efficient caching of watched paths
   - Reference counting for resource cleanup
   - Batched directory scanning

### Error Handling

The implementation will follow the project's "throw on error" approach:

1. **Clear Error Messages**
   - Specific error messages for each failure case
   - Include context information in error messages
   - Use custom exception classes for different error types

2. **Resource Cleanup**
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources on error
   - Implement graceful shutdown of threads
   - Release OS-level watches when no longer needed

3. **Logging**
   - Log all significant events and errors
   - Include detailed context in log messages
   - Follow the project's standardized logging format

### Cross-Platform Considerations

The implementation will ensure consistent behavior across different operating systems:

1. **Platform Detection**
   - Automatic detection of the operating system
   - Selection of the appropriate implementation
   - Fallback to polling if native APIs are unavailable

2. **Path Normalization**
   - Consistent path handling across platforms
   - Conversion between platform-specific and normalized paths
   - Proper handling of path separators

3. **API Abstraction**
   - Abstract away platform-specific details
   - Consistent event types across platforms
   - Unified error handling
