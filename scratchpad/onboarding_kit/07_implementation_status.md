# Implementation Status: Current State vs. Expected Architecture

This document provides an assessment of the current implementation state of the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system compared to the expected architecture. It helps new team members understand which parts of the system are implemented, which are in progress, and which are still in the planning phase.

## Overview

The Documentation-Based Programming system is currently in the **early development phase**, with significant portions still being implemented. While the architecture, design principles, and documentation are well-established, the actual implementation is progressing methodically with key components at various stages of completion.

    end

    %% Development sequence

```

The system is in a phase where:
- Architecture and design documents are comprehensive and detailed
- Infrastructure components have early implementations
- Core logical components are in various stages of development
- Advanced features remain mostly conceptual or in planning
- Practical integration points are still being implemented
- Significant development work is needed to achieve full functionality
