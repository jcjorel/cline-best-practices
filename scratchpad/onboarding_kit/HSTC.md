# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: onboarding_kit

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains a comprehensive set of onboarding documents that introduce new developers to the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. It provides structured, sequential documentation explaining the project's purpose, architecture, workflows, data models, and development practices. The kit features rich diagrams and practical examples to facilitate understanding of complex concepts, serving as an entry point for developers joining the project. As part of the scratchpad area, these documents are meant for orientation rather than being part of the core documentation set.
