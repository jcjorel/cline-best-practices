# Documentation-Based Programming Onboarding Kit

## Purpose

This onboarding kit provides a comprehensive introduction to the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system for new developers. It explains the project's purpose, architecture, workflows, and development practices through a series of detailed, diagram-rich documents.

## For New Developers

If you're new to the project, start with the [index.md](index.md) file, which provides a guided path through all the onboarding materials. The kit is designed to be read in sequence, with each document building on concepts from the previous ones.

## Documents Included

1. **[Overview](01_overview.md)** - High-level introduction to the DBP system
2. **[System Architecture](02_system_architecture.md)** - Detailed explanation of system components
3. **[Key Workflows](03_key_workflows.md)** - How the system processes changes
4. **[Data Models](04_data_models.md)** - Core data structures used in the system
5. **[Development Guide](05_development_guide.md)** - How to start working with DBP

## Key Features

- **Visual Learning**: Rich with diagrams that illustrate system architecture and workflows
- **Practical Examples**: Contains code examples and practical implementation guidance
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: Breaks down complex concepts into understandable pieces
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses both high-level concepts and implementation details

## Using This Kit

For the best onboarding experience:

1. Start with the [index.md](index.md) file
2. Read the documents in numerical order (01-05)
3. Refer back to specific sections as needed during development
4. Use the provided diagrams to understand system relationships

## Keeping Documentation Updated

This onboarding kit should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the system architecture, workflows, or development practices. Each document follows the project's documentation standards and can be maintained using the standard Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context (HSTC) system.
