## How to Use This Kit

If you're new to the project, we recommend reading these documents in order, as each builds upon concepts introduced in the previous ones. This structured approach will give you a comprehensive understanding of the system's purpose, architecture, workflows, and implementation details.

Once you complete this onboarding kit, you should have a clear understanding of:

- What the Documentation-Based Programming system does and why it exists
- How the system architecture is organized and how components interact
- Key workflows that maintain documentation-code consistency
- The data models that support these workflows
- How to set up your development environment and start contributing

## Next Steps

After reviewing this onboarding kit:

1. Set up your development environment following the [Development Guide](05_development_guide.md)
2. Explore the core documentation in the `doc/` directory
3. Look at the implementation in `src/dbp/`
4. Try setting up a test project to see the DBP system in action
