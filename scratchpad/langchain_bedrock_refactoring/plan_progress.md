## Consistency Check
✅ Completed

The implementation has been checked for consistency across all components:
- The `EnhancedChatBedrockConverse` class provides a base implementation with generic text extraction
- Model-specific classes extend this base class and override the `_extract_text_from_chunk` method
- The client factory correctly selects the appropriate model-specific class
- Tests verify the behavior of all components including inheritance patterns
- Compatibility wrappers ensure backward compatibility while encouraging migration

## Notes
- The refactoring focuses on transitioning from the legacy `EnhancedBedrockBase` approach to a fully LangChain-based implementation.
- Key considerations include preserving model-specific capabilities and ensuring a clean separation of concerns for text extraction from different model responses.
