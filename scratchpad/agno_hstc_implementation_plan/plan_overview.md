# HSTC Implementation with Agno - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps to build the Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context (HSTC) feature using the Agno framework and Amazon Bedrock models. The implementation will create a two-stage processing pipeline that uses Nova Micro for efficient file analysis and Claude 3.7 for high-quality documentation generation.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Structure
Create the basic project structure, directory layout, and establish dependencies on the Agno framework. This phase sets up the foundation for the implementation.

### Phase 2: Data Models and Utilities
Implement the core data models and utility functions that will be shared across the HSTC components.

### Phase 3: File Analyzer Agent
Implement the File Analyzer Agent using Nova Micro model, focusing on efficient file analysis, language detection, and dependency extraction.

### Phase 4: Documentation Generator Agent
Implement the Documentation Generator Agent using Claude 3.7 model, focusing on high-quality documentation generation that meets HSTC standards.

### Phase 5: HSTC Manager
Implement the HSTC Manager component that orchestrates the workflow between agents, processes files, and generates implementation plans.

### Phase 6: CLI Integration
Integrate the HSTC functionality into the command-line interface, providing user-friendly commands and options.

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation
Create comprehensive tests for the implementation, focusing on different file types, languages, and edge cases.

## Directory Structure

The implementation will follow this directory structure:

```
src/
└── dbp_cli/
    └── commands/
        └── hstc_agno/
            ├── __init__.py
            ├── agents.py      # Agent implementations (File Analyzer and Documentation Generator)
            ├── cli.py         # CLI command definitions
            ├── manager.py     # HSTC Manager implementation
            ├── models.py      # Data models
            └── utils.py       # Utility functions
```

## Integration Strategy

This implementation is designed to coexist with the existing LangChain-based implementation:
- Uses a different command group (`hstc_agno` instead of `hstc`)
- Processes files individually rather than entire directories
- Uses Amazon Bedrock models (Nova Micro and Claude 3.7) specifically
- Uses Agno's session state for data persistence

## Next Steps

Start with Phase 1 (Project Setup and Structure) and proceed sequentially through the phases. Each phase builds upon the previous one, and the implementation should be tested at the end of each phase to ensure correctness.
