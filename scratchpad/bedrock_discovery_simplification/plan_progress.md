## Implementation Summary

The Bedrock Model Discovery simplification has been successfully implemented as planned:

1. **BaseDiscovery Class**: 
   - Simplified to remove external dependencies on DiscoveryCache and RegionLatencyTracker
   - Streamlined constructor with minimal requirements
   - Simplified threading model with a single lock

2. **Scan Utilities**:
   - Consolidated multiple scan functions into a single unified function
   - Simplified parameter lists with sensible defaults
   - Added optional latency tracking callback
   - Removed direct dependency on external components

3. **BedrockModelDiscovery Class**:
   - Integrated caching directly into the class, removing DiscoveryCache dependency
   - Simplified singleton implementation with optional initial scanning
   - Consolidated scanning methods with clearer API
   - Integrated latency tracking directly instead of external component
   - Added simple cache file management operations
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
   
4. **API Improvements**:
   - More consistent method signatures
   - Better parameter naming
   - Sensible defaults for cleaner client code
   - Comprehensive documentation
   
The implementation achieves all goals from the simplification plan: reduced code complexity, fewer external dependencies, simpler interfaces, integrated caching, and maintained functionality - all while ensuring backward compatibility with existing code.
