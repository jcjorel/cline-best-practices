## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Command behavior differences | Medium | High | Comprehensive test suite |
| Breaking existing scripts | High | Medium | Maintain backward compatibility |
| Integration with Click-based commands | Medium | Medium | Clear integration patterns |
| Missing core functionality | Low | High | Review command handlers in detail |
| Performance impact | Low | Low | Benchmark key commands |

## Next Steps

✅ All planned tasks have been completed! The Click-based CLI is now fully functional with:
- Complete command suite that matches the legacy CLI
- Improved documentation and help text
- Migration guide for users
- Transition timeline and plan
- Verification tests
- Fixed bugs that prevented the CLI from running correctly

The CLI can be accessed through the `dbp-click` command, and has been tested to work with all core functionality.
