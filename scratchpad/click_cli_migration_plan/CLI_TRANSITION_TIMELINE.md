# CLI Transition Timeline

This document outlines the timeline and strategy for transitioning from the legacy CLI (`dbp`) to the new Click-based CLI (`dbp-click`).

## Current State (May 2025)

- Initial release of the Click-based CLI implementation
- Both CLI versions available side-by-side:
  - Legacy CLI: `dbp` (with deprecation warnings)
  - New CLI: `dbp-click`
- Full feature parity between both interfaces

  - Bug fixes and improvements based on early user feedback
  - Enhanced testing and compatibility verification
  
- **Version 0.1.2** (July 2025)
  - Additional bug fixes
  - Performance improvements

- **Communication Plan**:
  - Announcement of transition on project blog and in release notes
  - Email to all known users about the transition plan
  - Documentation updates with clear migration examples

## Phase 2: New Feature Phase (September 2025 - December 2025)

**Duration: 4 months**

  - More aggressive deprecation warnings in legacy CLI
  
- **Communication Plan**:
  - Highlight new Click-only features in release notes
  - Tutorial videos demonstrating the advantages of the new CLI
  - Offer migration support for enterprise users

## Phase 3: Legacy Aliasing (January 2026 - March 2026)

**Duration: 3 months**

- **Version 0.3.0** (January 2026)
  - Legacy `dbp` command is aliased to `dbp-click`
  - Original legacy implementation removed
  - Backwards compatibility layer added to ensure scripts continue to work
  
- **Version 0.3.1** (February 2026)
  - Bug fixes related to aliasing
  - Final compatibility adjustments
  
- **Communication Plan**:
  - Final migration notice to all users
  - Update all documentation to reflect the aliasing
  - Provide command mapping reference

## Phase 4: Full Transition (April 2026 - June 2026)

**Duration: 3 months**

- **Version 1.0.0** (April 2026)
  - Official stable release
  - Fully Click-based architecture
  - Retention of `dbp` command name for backwards compatibility
  - Legacy compatibility layer maintained
  
- **Version 1.1.0** (June 2026)
  - Begin new feature development on stable Click foundation
  - Focus on extensibility and API improvements
  - Maintain backwards compatibility

- **Communication Plan**:
  - Announce stable 1.0.0 release
  - Close legacy CLI transition project
  - Begin communicating about new feature roadmap

## Key Milestones

1. **May 2025**: Initial dual-CLI release
2. **September 2025**: Begin Click-only features
3. **January 2026**: Legacy CLI aliased to Click CLI
4. **April 2026**: Full transition complete with 1.0.0 release

## Script and Automation Compatibility

Throughout the transition period, special attention will be paid to ensuring that existing scripts and automation that rely on the CLI continue to work. The compatibility strategy includes:

- **Command output format stability**: Ensuring that the output format remains stable for machine parsing
- **Exit code consistency**: Maintaining the same exit codes for all operations
- **Argument handling**: Ensuring all legacy arguments continue to work as expected
- **Environment variable support**: Maintaining support for existing environment variables

## User Impact Assessment

| User Type | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Casual users | Low | Simple command replacement |
| Script authors | Medium | Documentation and testing support |
| Enterprise integrations | High | Extended support and consultation |

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered during any phase of the transition, the following rollback strategy will be implemented:

1. Revert to dual CLI system
2. Fix issues in Click-based implementation
3. Resume transition with revised timeline

## Progress Tracking

Progress on the transition will be tracked using the following metrics:

- Percentage of users migrated to `dbp-click`
- Number of reported issues
- Number of scripts updated
- Test coverage for compatibility layer
