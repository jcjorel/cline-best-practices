# Implementation Plan: Splitting models.py into Two Files

⚠️ CRITICAL: CODING ASSISTANT MUST READ THESE DOCUMENTATION FILES COMPLETELY BEFORE EXECUTING ANY TASKS IN THIS PLAN

## Documentation Files Referenced

- `/home/jcjorel/cline-best-practices/src/dbp/llm/bedrock/discovery/models.py` - Source file to be split
- `/home/jcjorel/cline-best-practices/doc/CODING_GUIDELINES.md` - Project coding standards
- `/home/jcjorel/cline-best-practices/doc/DESIGN.md` - Project architectural principles

## Project Context

The `BedrockModelDiscovery` class in `models.py` has grown too large, causing truncation issues during updates. This implementation plan details splitting this file into two smaller files with clear separation of concerns while ensuring all functionality is preserved.

## Implementation Phases

1. **File Split Structure Design** - Define the exact structure of the split, including class hierarchy and method distribution
2. **Core File Implementation** - Create the base `models_core.py` file with core discovery functionality
3. **Capabilities File Implementation** - Create the `models_capabilities.py` file with extended capability features
4. **Codebase Reference Updates** - Update all references in the codebase to point to the new files
5. **Testing and Verification** - Verify the implementation with tests and ensure all functionality works as expected

## Detailed Implementation Plan Files

1. [File Split Structure Design](plan_file_splitting.md) - Detailed design of the split architecture
2. [Codebase Reference Updates](plan_codebase_updates.md) - Plan for updating all references in the codebase
3. [Progress Tracking](plan_progress.md) - Track implementation progress

## Side-Car Progress File

Progress is tracked in [plan_progress.md](plan_progress.md). This file will be updated as implementation progresses.

## Key Design Considerations

- **Singleton Pattern** - Ensure the singleton pattern works correctly across both files
- **Hierarchy Approach** - Use class inheritance to extend core functionality with capabilities
- **Backward Compatibility** - No backward compatibility layer will be created; all references will be updated directly
- **Minimal Changes** - Methods should maintain their interfaces to minimize changes throughout the codebase

## Implementation Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking singleton pattern | Implement specialized `get_instance()` method in the capabilities class |
| Missing file references | Comprehensive search for all references before implementation |
| Circular imports | Careful design of import structure between new files |
| Test failures | Update test patch decorators with new class paths |
