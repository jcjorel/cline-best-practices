# Click Context Handling Fix: Implementation Plan Overview

⚠️ **CRITICAL: CODING ASSISTANT MUST READ THESE DOCUMENTATION FILES COMPLETELY BEFORE EXECUTING ANY TASKS IN THIS PLAN**

## Documentation References

| File | Relevance |
|------|-----------|
| `src/dbp_cli/cli_click/common.py` | Contains the current Context class implementation and context passing mechanism |
| `src/dbp_cli/cli_click/main.py` | Main CLI entry point where context initialization should occur |
| Click Library Documentation | Reference for proper context handling in Click applications |

## Issue Summary

We're currently mishandling the Click context by defining our own `Context` class in `common.py` and using a custom `pass_context` decorator. This causes commands to receive our custom Context object instead of Click's native context object, which prevents access to Click's context features (command invocation, parent command access, etc.).

## Implementation Approach

We will implement **Option 1: Use Click's Context with obj Attribute** as discussed. This approach:

1. Uses Click's native context (`click.Context`)
2. Stores our application services in the `obj` attribute of Click's context
3. Ensures commands have access to both Click's context features and our application services
4. Follows Click's recommended pattern for context sharing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Modifications to Context Handling
- Rename our custom context class to avoid ambiguity
- Update main CLI entry point to initialize our context properly
- Modify core decorators to work with Click's native context

### Phase 2: Command Migration Strategy
- Develop a migration approach for updating commands
- Document required changes for command implementation
- Create example templates for consistent implementation

### Phase 3: Testing Strategy
- Define test cases to verify context is working correctly
- Develop validation tests for context features
- Create regression tests to ensure existing functionality works

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates
- Update docstrings and code comments
- Create developer documentation for the new pattern
- Document migration guidelines for future command implementations

## Implementation Files

This plan consists of the following detailed implementation files:

1. [Phase 1: Core Modifications](plan_phase1_core_modifications.md)
2. [Phase 2: Command Migration Strategy](plan_phase2_command_migration.md)
3. [Phase 3: Testing Strategy](plan_phase3_testing.md)
4. [Phase 4: Documentation Updates](plan_phase4_documentation.md)

Progress is tracked in [plan_progress.md](plan_progress.md).

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing this plan:

1. Commands will correctly receive Click's native context
2. Application services will be accessible via the context's `obj` attribute
3. Commands will have access to Click's context features (invoke, parent commands, etc.)
4. The code will follow Click's recommended best practices for context handling
5. The implementation will be more maintainable and easier to understand
