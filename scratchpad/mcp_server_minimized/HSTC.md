# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: mcp_server_minimized

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains implementation plans and modified code for a minimized version of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It serves as a scratchpad for designing a lightweight alternative to the full MCP server implementation with reduced dependencies and simplified architecture. The minimized implementation focuses on core functionality while removing advanced features that aren't essential for basic operation. This approach aims to provide faster startup times, reduced resource consumption, and easier deployment for scenarios where the full MCP server capabilities aren't required.
