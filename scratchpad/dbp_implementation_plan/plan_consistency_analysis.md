# Consistency Analysis Engine Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document details the implementation plan for the Consistency Analysis Engine of the Documentation-Based Programming system. Based on the project documentation, this component analyzes relationships between documentation and code, identifies inconsistencies, and provides the foundation for the recommendation system.

## Consistency Analysis Requirements

From the project documentation, the Consistency Analysis Engine must:

1. Create and maintain a document relationship graph
2. Analyze relationships between documentation and code
3. Identify inconsistencies between related documentation files
4. Detect when code implementations deviate from documented design principles
5. Process only one codebase file at a time
6. Use background incremental processing with priority queuing
7. Support three types of analysis: documentation-to-documentation consistency, documentation-to-code alignment, and code-to-documentation impact analysis

## Implementation Components

### 1. Document Relationship Graph

The Document Relationship Graph will represent the relationships between documents in the project:

```python
class DocumentRelationshipGraph:
    def __init__(self, db_session):
        """Initialize graph with database session."""
        self.db_session = db_session
        self.graph = {}  # In-memory representation for quick access
        self._load_from_database()
        
    def _load_from_database(self):
        """Load document relationships from database."""
        # Query document references and relationships
        # Build in-memory graph representation
        
    def add_relationship(self, source_path, target_path, relation_type, topic, scope):
        """Add a relationship between two documents."""
        # Validate paths
        # Create relationship in database
        # Update in-memory graph
        
    def remove_relationship(self, source_path, target_path, relation_type=None):
        """Remove relationship between documents."""
        # Remove from database
        # Update in-memory graph
        
    def get_related_documents(self, path, relation_type=None, depth=1):
        """Get related documents up to specified depth."""
        # Traverse graph to find related documents
        # Filter by relation type if specified
        
    def get_impact_documents(self, path):
        """Get documents that would be impacted by changes to the specified document."""
        # Find all documents that depend on the specified document
        
    def detect_circular_dependencies(self):
        """Detect circular dependencies in the document graph."""
        # Implement cycle detection algorithm
        
    def visualize(self):
        """Generate visualization of document relationships."""
        # Create Mermaid diagram representation of relationships
```

### 2. Inconsistency Detection Engine

The Inconsistency Detection Engine will identify various types of inconsistencies:

```python
class InconsistencyDetector:
    def __init__(self, db_session, relationship_graph):
        """Initialize detector with database session and relationship graph."""
        self.db_session = db_session
        self.relationship_graph = relationship_graph
        
    def analyze_document_consistency(self, doc_path):
        """Analyze consistency between a document and its related documents."""
        # Get related documents
        # Compare document content for consistency
        # Identify conflicts or inconsistencies
        
    def analyze_doc_to_code_alignment(self, code_path):
        """Analyze alignment between code file and its documentation."""
        # Get code file metadata
        # Find related documentation
        # Check if implementation matches documentation
        
    def analyze_code_to_doc_impact(self, code_path):
        """Analyze impact of code changes on documentation."""
        # Get code file change history
        # Find related documentation
        # Determine if changes require documentation updates
        
    def detect_design_principle_violations(self, code_path):
        """Detect violations of documented design principles."""
        # Get code file metadata
        # Get design principles from relevant documentation
        # Check if code adheres to design principles
        
    def create_inconsistency_record(self, type, severity, description, affected_paths, suggested_resolution):
        """Create an inconsistency record in the database."""
        # Generate UUID for inconsistency
        # Create record in database
        # Return inconsistency record
```

### 3. Analysis Priority Queue

The Analysis Priority Queue will manage the order of file processing:

```python
class AnalysisPriorityQueue:
    def __init__(self, db_session):
        """Initialize queue with database session."""
        self.db_session = db_session
        self.queue = PriorityQueue()
        
    def add_file(self, file_path, priority=0, analysis_type=None):
        """Add a file to the queue with specified priority."""
        # Higher priority values indicate higher priority
        # Create queue entry with file path, priority, and analysis type
        # Add to priority queue
        
    def next_file(self):
        """Get the next file to analyze based on priority."""
        # Get highest priority item from queue
        # Return file path and analysis type
        
    def remove_file(self, file_path):
        """Remove a file from the queue."""
        # Remove file from queue if present
        
    def contains_file(self, file_path):
        """Check if a file is in the queue."""
        # Check if file is in queue
        
    def reprioritize(self, file_path, new_priority):
        """Update the priority of a file in the queue."""
        # Remove and re-add with new priority
```

### 4. Background Analysis Processor

The Background Analysis Processor will manage the analysis process:

```python
class BackgroundAnalysisProcessor:
    def __init__(self, db_session, relationship_graph, inconsistency_detector, priority_queue):
        """Initialize processor with necessary components."""
        self.db_session = db_session
        self.relationship_graph = relationship_graph
        self.inconsistency_detector = inconsistency_detector
        self.priority_queue = priority_queue
        self.running = False
        self.current_file = None
        
    def start(self):
        """Start background processing."""
        if not self.running:
            self.running = True
            self._process_queue()
        
    def stop(self):
        """Stop background processing."""
        self.running = False
        
    def _process_queue(self):
        """Process files in the priority queue."""
        # Run in background thread
        while self.running and not self.priority_queue.empty():
            # Get next file
            file_path, analysis_type = self.priority_queue.next_file()
            self.current_file = file_path
            
            # Perform appropriate analysis
            if analysis_type == "doc_to_doc":
                self.inconsistency_detector.analyze_document_consistency(file_path)
            elif analysis_type == "doc_to_code":
                self.inconsistency_detector.analyze_doc_to_code_alignment(file_path)
            elif analysis_type == "code_to_doc":
                self.inconsistency_detector.analyze_code_to_doc_impact(file_path)
            elif analysis_type == "design_principles":
                self.inconsistency_detector.detect_design_principle_violations(file_path)
            
            self.current_file = None
        
    def queue_file_for_analysis(self, file_path, priority=0):
        """Queue a file for all applicable analysis types."""
        # Determine file type (code or documentation)
        # Add appropriate analysis tasks to queue
        
    def get_status(self):
        """Get current processing status."""
        # Return status information including:
        # - Whether processing is running
        # - Current file being processed
        # - Queue size
        # - Recently processed files
```

### 5. Relationship Discovery Engine

The Relationship Discovery Engine will automatically detect relationships between documents:

```python
class RelationshipDiscoveryEngine:
    def __init__(self, db_session, relationship_graph):
        """Initialize discovery engine with database session and relationship graph."""
        self.db_session = db_session
        self.relationship_graph = relationship_graph
        
    def discover_relationships(self, doc_path):
        """Discover relationships for a document."""
        # Read document content
        # Parse for references to other documents
        # Extract relationship information
        # Add to relationship graph
        
    def analyze_reference_documentation_sections(self, code_path):
        """Analyze header [Reference documentation] sections."""
        # Get file metadata
        # Extract reference documentation list
        # Create relationships in graph
        
    def analyze_document_relationships_file(self):
        """Analyze the DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md file."""
        # Parse DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md content
        # Extract defined relationships
        # Update relationship graph
        
    def infer_relationships_from_imports(self, code_path):
        """Infer relationships from code imports."""
        # Analyze code imports
        # Map to documentation files
        # Add inferred relationships
```

### 6. Semantic Analysis Engine

The Semantic Analysis Engine will use NLP techniques to identify semantic relationships and inconsistencies:

```python
class SemanticAnalysisEngine:
    def __init__(self, llm_coordinator):
        """Initialize semantic analysis engine with LLM coordinator."""
        self.llm_coordinator = llm_coordinator
        
    def compare_document_content(self, doc1_content, doc2_content):
        """Compare content of two documents for semantic consistency."""
        # Use LLM to compare document content
        # Identify semantic contradictions or inconsistencies
        
    def extract_design_principles(self, doc_content):
        """Extract design principles from documentation content."""
        # Use LLM to identify design principles
        # Return structured representation of principles
        
    def check_code_compliance(self, code_content, design_principles):
        """Check if code complies with design principles."""
        # Use LLM to analyze code against principles
        # Identify violations or deviations
        
    def identify_documentation_gaps(self, code_content, doc_content):
        """Identify gaps between code functionality and documentation."""
        # Use LLM to compare code and documentation
        # Identify undocumented features or functionality
```

## Integration Points

The Consistency Analysis Engine interfaces with several other system components:

1. **Database Layer**: Access to document references, relationships, and inconsistency records
2. **File System Monitor**: Notification of file changes for analysis
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Access to extracted metadata from code files
4. **LLM Coordination**: Access to LLM for semantic analysis
5. **Recommendation Generator**: Providing inconsistency records for recommendation generation

## Error Handling Strategy

Following the project's "throw on error" principle:

1. All operations will include comprehensive error handling
2. Errors will be caught, logged with context, and rethrown
3. Error messages will clearly indicate what failed and why
4. Background processing will recover gracefully from errors

## Performance Considerations

To meet performance requirements (<5% CPU, <100MB RAM):

1. Process only one file at a time to maintain consistent resource usage
2. Implement priority-based processing to focus on high-impact files
3. Use efficient graph representations for relationship tracking
4. Leverage database indexes for relationship queries
5. Implement intelligent throttling during high system load
6. Cache frequently accessed relationship data
7. Batch database operations for efficiency
8. Limit LLM semantic analysis to focused sets of files

## Thread Safety and Concurrency

1. Implement thread-safe access to the relationship graph
2. Ensure priority queue is thread-safe
3. Use proper locking for status updates
4. Design background processor for safe shutdown
5. Handle concurrent database access properly

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each component with mock dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: Test components together with in-memory database
3. **Graph Algorithm Tests**: Validate relationship traversal and detection
4. **Performance Tests**: Verify CPU and memory usage constraints
5. **Concurrency Tests**: Ensure thread safety under load

## Security Considerations

As outlined in SECURITY.md:

1. All file access follows existing filesystem permissions
2. No external data transmission
3. Resource usage is carefully controlled
4. All document paths are validated to prevent path traversal
5. Analysis is performed with lowest necessary privileges
