## Key Architecture Insights

### LLM-Based Metadata Extraction

The system uses Amazon Nova Lite for metadata extraction from code files. This approach:
- Avoids the need for language-specific parsers
- Allows extraction of semantic meaning from documentation
- Provides flexibility in handling various documentation formats
- Requires careful prompt engineering to ensure consistent results

### Coordinator-Based LLM Architecture

The LLM coordination architecture uses a hierarchical approach:
- Coordinator LLM manages the workflow and delegates to specialized tools
- Internal tools handle specific types of queries (codebase, documentation, etc.)
- Asynchronous job management allows parallel processing
- Standardized prompts ensure consistent tool behavior

### Documentation-First Approach

The implementation enforces a documentation-first approach:
- Documentation is the single source of truth
- Code changes trigger documentation consistency checks
- Recommendations are generated to maintain consistency
- Design decisions are preserved throughout the development process

### Security Considerations

The implementation prioritizes security:
- All processing occurs locally with no data transmission
- Project isolation prevents cross-project data leakage
- Resource usage limits prevent system impact
- File system permissions are strictly enforced
- No arbitrary code execution occurs

## Source Documentation Context

### Core Architecture Principles (from DESIGN.md)

- Documentation as Source of Truth
- Automatic Consistency Maintenance
- Global Contextual Awareness
- Design Decision Preservation
- Reasonable Default Values

### Implementation Principles (from DESIGN.md)

- Avoid Manual Parsing
- Metadata Normalization via LLM
- Precise LLM Prompts
- Thread-Safe Database Access
- Code Size Governance
- Explicit Error Handling

### Recent Design Decisions (from DESIGN_DECISIONS.md)

- LLM-Based Metadata Extraction
- External Prompt Template Files
- LLM-Based Language Detection

These principles and decisions form the foundation of our implementation approach and must be adhered to throughout the development process.
