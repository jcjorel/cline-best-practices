# Documentation-Based Programming System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps to build the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system as defined in the project's documentation. The DBP system treats documentation as the single source of truth in a project, ensuring consistency between documentation and code.

The system will be implemented in phases with clear milestones to ensure orderly development and integration. Each phase will focus on specific components, building from core infrastructure to user-facing features.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Database setup and schema implementation
- File system monitoring infrastructure
- Configuration management system

### Phase 2: Metadata Extraction Engine
- LLM integration for Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- File header and function extraction implementation
- Memory cache and persistent storage integration

### Phase 3: Consistency Analysis & Recommendation System
- Document relationship graph implementation
- Inconsistency detection algorithms
- Recommendation generation system
- Developer feedback handling

### Phase 4: MCP Server Implementation
- LLM coordination architecture
- Internal tools implementation
- MCP exposed tools implementation

### Phase 5: Python CLI Client
- Command-line interface implementation
- MCP client integration
- Configuration and connection management

### Phase 6: Testing, Documentation, and Refinement
- Unit and integration testing
- Documentation completion
- Performance optimization
- Security verification

## Essential Context from Documentation

### Core Architectural Principles

From [DESIGN.md](../doc/DESIGN.md):

1. **Documentation as Source of Truth**: Documentation takes precedence over code for understanding project intent.
2. **Automatic Consistency Maintenance**: System actively ensures consistency between documentation and code.
3. **Global Contextual Awareness**: AI assistants maintain awareness of entire project context.
4. **Design Decision Preservation**: All significant design decisions are captured and maintained.
5. **Reasonable Default Values**: System provides carefully selected default values for all configurable parameters.

### Key Implementation Principles

From [DESIGN.md](../doc/DESIGN.md) and [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](../doc/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md):

1. **Avoid Manual Parsing**: Leverage Python libraries for parsing structured data.
2. **Metadata Normalization via LLM**: Allow LLMs to handle metadata extraction and normalization.
3. **Precise LLM Prompts**: Provide detailed JSON schemas and formats in LLM tool prompts.
4. **Thread-Safe Database Access**: Ensure all database operations are thread-safe.
5. **Code Size Governance**: Maintain files with maximum 600 lines.
6. **Explicit Error Handling**: Use "throw on error" for all error cases.
7. **LLM-Based Metadata Extraction**: Extraction MUST be performed exclusively by LLM with no programmatic fallback.
8. **External Prompt Template Files**: LLM prompts for internal tools are read directly from doc/llm/prompts/.
9. **LLM-Based Language Detection**: No programmatic language detection is needed.

### Critical Requirements

From [PR-FAQ.md](../doc/PR-FAQ.md) and [WORKING_BACKWARDS.md](../doc/WORKING_BACKWARDS.md):

1. **Performance**: Indexing project metadata within 10 seconds of any file change.
2. **Resource Usage**: <5% CPU and <100MB RAM usage.
3. **Local Processing**: All data processed locally with no external transmission.
4. **Complete Isolation**: Perfect separation between indexed projects.
5. **Security**: No code execution, strictly filesystem permission enforcement.
