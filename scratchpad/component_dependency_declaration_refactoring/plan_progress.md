This file tracks the progress of the component dependency declaration refactoring implementation.

## Status Legend
- ❌ Not started
- 🔄 In progress
- ✅ Completed
- 🚧 Implementation in progress
- ✨ Fully implemented
- ✓ Verified working

## Implementation Status

### Planning Phase
- ✅ Create plan overview
- ✅ Create plan for Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Changes
- ✅ Create plan for Phase 2: Integration & Component Updates
- ✅ Create plan for Phase 3: Cleanup & Final Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Changes
- ✅ Modify Component base class
- ✅ Enhance ComponentSystem
- ✅ Create centralized ComponentRegistry

### Phase 2: Integration & Component Updates
- ✅ Update LifecycleManager
- ✅ Update component implementations (progress details below)
  - ✅ ConfigManagerComponent
  - ✅ DatabaseComponent
  - ✅ FileSystemMonitorComponent
  - ✅ MemoryCacheComponent
  - ✅ MetadataExtractionComponent
  - ✅ ConsistencyAnalysisComponent
  - ✅ DocRelationshipsComponent
  - ✅ RecommendationGeneratorComponent
  - ✅ SchedulerComponent
  - ✅ LLMCoordinatorComponent
  - ✅ MCPServerComponent
  - ✅ FileAccessComponent
  - ✅ Other components

### Phase 3: Cleanup & Final Implementation
- ✅ Remove backward compatibility code
  - ✅ Removed dependencies property from Component base class
  - ✅ Made dependencies parameter required in ComponentSystem.register()
  - ✅ Removed fallback code in ComponentSystem.initialize_all()
  - ✅ Update LifecycleManager registration process
- ✅ Update documentation
  - ✅ Updated Component Initialization documentation
  - ✅ Added entry to Design Decisions

## Consistency Check Status
- ✅ Verify compatibility with Component Initialization design
- ✅ Verify all components follow the new pattern
- ✅ Test initialization with new dependency mechanism
- ✅ Fix post-refactoring issues

## Post-Implementation Issues Resolved
| Issue | Description | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Missing dependency | The memory_cache component was trying to access config_manager but it wasn't declared as a dependency in lifecycle.py | Updated the dependency list in lifecycle.py to include config_manager |
| Circular dependency | Circular dependency between fs_monitor and change_queue components | 1. Reordered the component registration in lifecycle.py<br>2. Fixed the change_queue initialization to use dependency injection<br>3. Removed the deprecated dependencies property from change_queue|
| Missing dependency | The doc_relationships component was trying to access metadata_extraction but it wasn't declared as a dependency in lifecycle.py | Updated the dependency list in lifecycle.py to include metadata_extraction for the doc_relationships component |
| Initialize method incompatibility | The FilterComponent's initialize method didn't accept the dependencies parameter | 1. Removed the deprecated dependencies property<br>2. Updated the initialize method to accept and use the dependencies parameter |
| Missing dependency | The doc_relationships component was trying to access file_access but it wasn't declared as a dependency in lifecycle.py | Updated the dependency list in lifecycle.py to include file_access for the doc_relationships component |
| Missing dependency | The scheduler component was trying to access fs_monitor but it wasn't declared as a dependency in lifecycle.py | Updated the dependency list in lifecycle.py to include fs_monitor for the scheduler component |
| Missing dependency | The recommendation_generator component was trying to access database but it wasn't declared as a dependency in lifecycle.py | Updated the dependency list in lifecycle.py to include database for the recommendation_generator component |
| Missing dependency | The scheduler component was trying to access metadata_extraction but it wasn't declared as a dependency in lifecycle.py | Updated the dependency list in lifecycle.py to include metadata_extraction for the scheduler component |
| Missing dependency | The recommendation_generator component was trying to access llm_coordinator but it wasn't declared as a dependency in lifecycle.py | Updated the dependency list in lifecycle.py to include llm_coordinator for the recommendation_generator component |
