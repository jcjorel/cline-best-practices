# Scratchpad Directory

This directory serves as a temporary workspace for the Documentation-Based Programming system.

## Purpose

- Store implementation plans generated during planning mode
- Track progress with changelog files
- Provide a safe area for experimental code and documentation drafts
- Maintain temporary artifacts that should not be committed

## Common File Types

- `{TASK_NAME}_PLAN.md`: Implementation plans with task breakdowns
- `{TASK_NAME}_PLAN_CHANGELOG.md`: Progress tracking for plan implementation
- `{TASK_NAME}_DOC_UPDATE.md`: Proposed documentation updates
- Temporary code files and experimental implementations

## Usage Guidelines

1. Files in this directory should be considered temporary and may be deleted or overwritten
2. Use meaningful task names for files to make them easy to identify
3. Reference these files by full path when needed in other documents
4. Do not rely on these files for permanent storage
