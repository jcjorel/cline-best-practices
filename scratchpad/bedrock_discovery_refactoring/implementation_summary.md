# Bedrock Discovery Refactoring Implementation Summary

## Overview

This refactoring has successfully reorganized the Bedrock discovery code to integrate model and profile discovery, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. The changes follow the structure outlined in `plan_code_organization.md`, extracting shared functionality into common components.

## New Architecture

### File Structure

```
src/dbp/llm/bedrock/discovery/
├── models.py           # Updated BedrockModelDiscovery class
├── profiles.py         # Updated BedrockProfileDiscovery (cache-only)
├── discovery_core.py   # NEW: Base discovery class with shared functionality
├── scan_utils.py       # NEW: Scanning utilities for models and profiles
├── association.py      # NEW: Profile-to-model association utilities
├── cache.py            # Unchanged: Cache implementation
└── latency.py          # Unchanged: Latency tracking
```

### Core Components

1. **BaseDiscovery (discovery_core.py)**
   - Base class for discovery operations
   - Common region discovery functionality
   - Thread-safe parallel scanning

2. **Scanning Utilities (scan_utils.py)**
   - Model scanning functionality
   - Profile scanning functionality
   - Combined model+profile scanning

3. **Association Utilities (association.py)**
   - Functions for associating profiles with models
   - Helper functions for profile filtering

4. **Updated BedrockModelDiscovery**
   - Now inherits from BaseDiscovery
   - Uses shared scanning code
   - Handles combined model and profile discovery
   - New get_model method for profile-aware model retrieval

5. **Updated BedrockProfileDiscovery**
   - Now inherits from BaseDiscovery
   - Operates in cache-only mode
   - Adds deprecation warnings to scanning methods

## Key Improvements

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**
   - Common code extracted to base class and utility functions
   - Single scanning implementation for both models and profiles

2. **More Efficient API Usage**
   - Single pass scanning for both models and profiles
   - Combined threading model for all operations

3. **Cleaner Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Smaller, focused files with specific responsibilities

4. **Better API Surface**
   - New `get_model` method with profile information
   - Clearer deprecation path for direct profile scanning

## Migration Path for Existing Code

### Usage Changes

For applications using BedrockModelDiscovery:
- No changes needed for basic usage
- New `get_model` method available for profile-aware operations

For applications using BedrockProfileDiscovery:
- Existing methods continue to work (with deprecation warnings)
- Consider migrating to BedrockModelDiscovery.get_model() for newer code

### Example: Getting a model with associated profiles

Before:
```python
# Separate model and profile discovery
model_discovery = BedrockModelDiscovery.get_instance()
profile_discovery = BedrockProfileDiscovery.get_instance()

# Get model and then separately find profiles
model_regions = model_discovery.get_model_regions("anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0")
best_region = model_discovery.get_best_regions_for_model("anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0")[0]
models = model_discovery.scan_all_regions([best_region])
model = next((m for m in models.get(best_region, []) if m["modelId"] == "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0"), None)

# Separate API call to get profiles
profiles = profile_discovery.scan_profiles_in_region(best_region, "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0")

# Manual association
if model and profiles:
    model["associatedProfiles"] = profiles
```

After:
```python
# Single model discovery instance
model_discovery = BedrockModelDiscovery.get_instance(initial_scan=True)

# Get model with profiles already associated
model = model_discovery.get_model("anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0")

# Profiles are available in the model
if model and "referencedByInstanceProfiles" in model:
    profiles = model["referencedByInstanceProfiles"]
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for all new components
   - Test both individual functions and integrated behavior

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache analysis and improvement
   - Optimized region selection strategies

3. **Documentation**
   - Create user guides for the updated discovery system
   - Add detailed comments to clarify complex interactions

## Conclusion

This refactoring provides a more maintainable, efficient, and user-friendly approach to Bedrock model and profile discovery while ensuring backward compatibility. The new architecture allows for better sharing of logic between the two discovery classes and provides a cleaner path forward for future enhancements.
