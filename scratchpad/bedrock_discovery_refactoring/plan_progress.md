# Bedrock Discovery Refactoring: Implementation Progress

## Overview

This file tracks the progress of implementing the profile discovery integration with model discovery threading as outlined in `plan_code_organization.md`.

## File Creation Status

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `discovery_core.py` | ✅ Completed | Base discovery class and shared functionality |
| `scan_utils.py` | ✅ Completed | Scanning utilities for models and profiles |
| `association.py` | ✅ Completed | Profile-to-model association functionality |

## File Update Status

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `models.py` | ✅ Completed | Updated to inherit from BaseDiscovery, use shared code, and support profile association |
| `profiles.py` | ✅ Completed | Made cache-only with deprecation warnings and BaseDiscovery integration |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Create New Files

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create BaseDiscovery class in `discovery_core.py` | ✅ Completed | Foundation for both discovery classes |
| Implement parallel scanning utilities in `discovery_core.py` | ✅ Completed | Thread pool management |
| Implement model scanning in `scan_utils.py` | ✅ Completed | Extract from BedrockModelDiscovery._scan_region |
| Implement profile scanning in `scan_utils.py` | ✅ Completed | Extract from BedrockProfileDiscovery.scan_profiles_in_region |
| Implement combined scanning in `scan_utils.py` | ✅ Completed | Scan both models and profiles in one operation |
| Implement association utilities in `association.py` | ✅ Completed | Extract from BedrockProfileDiscovery.associate_profiles_with_models |

### Phase 2: Update Existing Files

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Update BedrockModelDiscovery to inherit from BaseDiscovery | ✅ Completed | Use common base class |
| Remove _scan_region implementation from BedrockModelDiscovery | ✅ Completed | Kept for backward compatibility but now delegates to scan_utils |
| Update scan_all_regions to use scan_region_combined | ✅ Completed | Single scan for both models and profiles |
| Add get_model method to BedrockModelDiscovery | ✅ Completed | Retrieve model with associated profiles |
| Update BedrockProfileDiscovery to inherit from BaseDiscovery | ✅ Completed | Use common base class |
| Add deprecation warnings to BedrockProfileDiscovery.scan_profiles_in_region | ✅ Completed | Mark method as deprecated |
| Update BedrockProfileDiscovery methods to use cache only | ✅ Completed | Remove direct API calls |

### Phase 3: Testing & Migration

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create unit tests for new files | ❌ Not started | Test shared functionality |
| Test refactored BedrockModelDiscovery | ❌ Not started | Ensure it works as expected |
| Test refactored BedrockProfileDiscovery | ❌ Not started | Ensure cache-only operations work |
| Create migration examples | ❌ Not started | Show how to update dependent code |
| Document API changes | ✅ Completed | Updated docstrings and code comments |

## Considerations

- ✅ Ensured backward compatibility with existing code
- ✅ Handled circular imports carefully by using function-level imports when needed
- ✅ Maintained thread safety across all operations
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling
- ✅ Updated all docstrings to reflect new functionality

## Core Requirements Met

- ✅ Single scan entry point with BedrockModelDiscovery.get_instance(initial_scan=True)
- ✅ Cache-only operations for most functionality after initial scan
- ✅ External API methods preserved:
  - BedrockModelDiscovery.get_model_regions
  - BedrockModelDiscovery.get_best_regions_for_model
  - BedrockModelDiscovery.is_model_available_in_region
  - BedrockModelDiscovery.get_all_models
  - NEW: BedrockModelDiscovery.get_model
