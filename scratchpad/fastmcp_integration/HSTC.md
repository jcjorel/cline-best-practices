# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: fastmcp_integration

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains a sample implementation for replacing the homemade MCP server implementation with the fastmcp library. The goal is to achieve optimal integration with fastmcp while preserving existing FastAPI usage and health route functionality. The implementation follows key principles including complete replacement of homemade MCP code, preservation of FastAPI integration, maintenance of the component architecture, and no backward compatibility requirements.
