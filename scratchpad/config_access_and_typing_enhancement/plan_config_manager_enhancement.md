# Phase 1: ConfigurationManager Enhancement

## Implementation Plan for ConfigurationManager Enhancement

### Current State

Currently, the ConfigurationManager class:
- Maintains a Pydantic model instance (`_config` of type `AppConfig`) for validated configuration
- Provides access to configuration values through the `get(key: str)` method with dot notation
- Doesn't expose direct access to the typed `_config` object

### Goal

Add a direct accessor method to ConfigurationManager that returns the strongly-typed config object (`_config`), enabling type-safe access to the configuration.

### Detailed Implementation Steps

#### 1. Add get_typed_config() Method

Add a new method to ConfigurationManager that returns the typed AppConfig object:

```python
def get_typed_config(self) -> AppConfig:
    """
    [Function intent]
    Returns the strongly-typed configuration object for type-safe access.
    
    [Implementation details]
    Provides direct access to the underlying Pydantic AppConfig model.
    
    [Design principles]
    Type safety for configuration access.
    
    Returns:
        AppConfig: The validated configuration model
        
    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If configuration is not initialized
    """
    if not self.initialized_flag:
        # Create and return a default AppConfig when not initialized
        self.logger.debug("Getting default typed configuration as manager is not initialized")
        return AppConfig()
        
    return self._config
```

#### 2. Update Type Annotations

Ensure proper type annotations for the `_config` attribute in ConfigurationManager:

```python
# At class level in ConfigurationManager
self._config: AppConfig = AppConfig()  # Holds the validated config
```

#### 3. Update Documentation

Update the class documentation to reflect the new capability:

```python
class ConfigurationManager:
    """
    Manages loading, validation, and access to application configuration
    using a singleton pattern and layered approach. Provides both string-based
    key access and strongly-typed configuration access.
    """
```

#### 4. Implementation Considerations

- This change maintains backward compatibility with existing code using the `get()` method
- The new method provides a cleaner, type-safe way to access configuration
- No changes to existing initialization or validation logic are required
- IDEs will now provide proper auto-completion for configuration access

### Impact Analysis

The addition of this accessor method:
- Provides a foundation for strongly-typed configuration access throughout the system
- Will be used by the enhanced InitializationContext in Phase 2
- Enables migration away from string-based configuration access in component code
- Improves type safety and IDE support without disrupting existing functionality

### Testing Strategy

- Unit test the `get_typed_config()` method with both initialized and uninitialized states
- Verify that the returned object is a valid AppConfig instance
- Ensure configuration values match those from the existing `get()` method
- Test that type annotations work correctly in dependent code
