# Cross-Reference Validation Plan

This document outlines the plan for ensuring all cross-references to DESIGN.md remain valid after restructuring the document.

## Impact Analysis of DESIGN.md Restructuring

Restructuring DESIGN.md may impact cross-references in several ways:

1. **Section References**: Documents that reference specific sections of DESIGN.md will need to be updated if those sections are moved or renamed.
2. **Anchor Links**: Markdown anchor links (e.g., `[link text](#section-name)`) will break if section titles change.
3. **Content References**: Documents that describe content found in specific parts of DESIGN.md will need to be updated if that content moves to a different section.

## Cross-Reference Sources

Based on the documentation read, these files contain references to DESIGN.md:

1. **doc/DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md**: Contains a comprehensive map of relationships between documentation files, including DESIGN.md.
2. **doc/DATA_MODEL.md**: Contains references to architecture principles from DESIGN.md.
3. **design/*.md files**: All design subdirectory files likely reference DESIGN.md.
4. **doc/API.md**: May reference DESIGN.md for architectural context.
5. **HSTC.md files**: Contains summaries of document content including DESIGN.md.

## Required Updates

### 1. DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md Updates

The relationship graph in DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md will need to be updated to reflect the new structure of DESIGN.md. Specific updates include:

- Ensure the "Depends on" and "Impacts" relationships remain valid
- Update topic descriptions if they reference sections that have been moved
- Verify the mermaid diagram correctly represents the new relationships

Example update pattern:
```markdown
## DESIGN.md
- Depends on: None
- Impacts: [DATA_MODEL.md](#data_modelmd) - Topic: System architecture - Scope: Entire system design
  - Update Topic reference if needed to match new section name
```

### 2. DATA_MODEL.md References

DATA_MODEL.md references specific architectural principles from DESIGN.md. Updates required:

- Verify that references to "Code Analysis Approach" now point to the Business Logic section
- Update any references to "Design Decisions" to point to the appropriate section in the new structure
- Check for direct quotes from DESIGN.md that might need updating

### 3. Design Subdirectory Files

Files in doc/design/ that reference DESIGN.md will need updates:

- Update references to reflect the new chapter structure
- Ensure consistency with the new organizational scheme
- Maintain bidirectional relationships as defined in DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md

### 4. API.md References

API.md references security principles from DESIGN.md:

- Update references to "Security and Data Handling" to point to the Middleware and Support Functions section
- Verify any architectural references match the new structure

### 5. HSTC.md Files

HSTC.md files contain summaries of documents including DESIGN.md:

- Update the summary of DESIGN.md in doc/HSTC.md to reflect the new chapter structure
- Update any references to design principles or architecture overview
- Ensure file intent descriptions match the restructured content

## Cross-Reference Validation Approach

To systematically validate and update cross-references:

1. **Identification**: Use search tools to identify all references to DESIGN.md across the codebase
2. **Mapping**: Create a mapping between old section references and their new locations
3. **Update**: Systematically update all references based on the mapping
4. **Verification**: Verify that all links function correctly after updates

## Search Pattern

To find all references to DESIGN.md, we'll use a search pattern like:

```
DESIGN\.md|design\.md|design document|architectural design
```

This will catch both direct references to the file and conceptual references to the design document.

## Reference Mapping

This table maps current references to their new locations:

| Current Reference | New Location |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Core Architecture Principles | General Architecture Overview → Core Architecture Principles |
| Implementation Principles | General Architecture Overview → Implementation Principles |
| System Components | Split across multiple sections (mapped individually below) |
| Python CLI Client | Provided Services → Python CLI Client |
| Documentation Monitoring | Middleware and Support Functions → Documentation Monitoring |
| Consistency Analysis Engine | Business Logic → Consistency Analysis |
| Recommendation Generator | Business Logic → Recommendation Generation |
| Component Initialization System | Middleware and Support Functions → Component Initialization System |
| File Structure | Middleware and Support Functions → File System Structure |
| Recommendation Workflow | Split between Provided Services and Business Logic sections |
| Security and Data Handling | Middleware and Support Functions → Security and Data Handling |
| Out of Scope | General Architecture Overview → Out of Scope |
| MCP Server Implementation | Split across multiple sections |
| MCP Server REST APIs | Provided Services → MCP Server REST APIs |
| Relationship to Other Components | External Dependencies toward Cooperating Systems |

## Update Process

1. For each affected document:
   - Check for references to DESIGN.md
   - Use the reference mapping to update references to point to the correct new section
   - Verify that the updated references correctly reflect the intended relationship

2. For DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md specifically:
   - Update the relationship graph to reflect the new structure
   - Ensure bidirectional references remain intact
   - Update the mermaid diagram to reflect the new relationships

## Post-Update Validation

After updating all cross-references:

1. Verify all links function correctly
2. Ensure the relationship graph accurately represents document relationships
3. Confirm that content references still point to the correct information
4. Update any generated documentation based on the new structure

## Required Cross-Reference Updates in DESIGN.md

The restructured DESIGN.md must maintain these cross-document references:

1. References to doc/design/*.md files (e.g., BACKGROUND_TASK_SCHEDULER.md)
2. References to DATA_MODEL.md for database details
3. References to SECURITY.md for security principles
4. References to API.md for API specifications
5. References to DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS.md for relationship information

These must be carefully preserved and updated to maintain document integrity.
