# Restructured DESIGN.md Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for restructuring DESIGN.md according to the required chapter structure. The new document will maintain all existing content while organizing it into the specified chapters.

## Document Header

The new DESIGN.md will begin with this header:

```markdown
# Documentation-Based Programming System Architecture

This document describes the architectural principles, components, and design decisions for the Documentation-Based Programming system, which treats documentation as the single source of truth in a project.
```

## New Document Structure

### 1. General Architecture Overview

This section will present a high-level overview of the system architecture with mermaid diagrams.

#### Content from Current Document:
- Introduction paragraph
- Core Architecture Principles (6 principles)
- Implementation Principles (10 principles)
- High-level description of component initialization

#### New Content to Add:

- System architecture mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "User Interfaces"
        CLI["Python CLI Client"]
        REC["Recommendation Interface"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Business Logic"
        METADATA["Metadata Extraction"]
        CONSISTENCY["Consistency Analysis"]
        RECOMMENDATION["Recommendation Generator"]
    end
    
    subgraph "External Systems"
        BEDROCK["AWS Bedrock"]
        OTHER["Other External Services"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Middleware & Support"
        MONITOR["Documentation Monitoring"]
        DB["Database"]
        SCHEDULER["Task Scheduler"]
        SECURITY["Security Layer"]
        COMPONENT["Component System"]
        MCP["MCP Server"]
    end
    
    CLI --> METADATA
    CLI --> MCP
    REC --> RECOMMENDATION
    
    METADATA --> CONSISTENCY
    CONSISTENCY --> RECOMMENDATION
    
    MCP --> BEDROCK
    
    METADATA --> MONITOR
    METADATA --> DB
    CONSISTENCY --> DB
    RECOMMENDATION --> DB
    
    MONITOR --> SCHEDULER
    DB --> COMPONENT
    MCP --> COMPONENT
    SCHEDULER --> COMPONENT
```

- Stack layers visualization:

```mermaid
graph TB
    UI["User Interfaces<br>(CLI Client, Recommendation Interface)"]
    BL["Business Logic<br>(Metadata Extraction, Consistency Analysis, Recommendation Generation)"]
    EXT["External Dependencies<br>(AWS Bedrock, Other Services)"]
    MID["Middleware & Support Functions<br>(Monitoring, Database, Scheduling, Security, Component System)"]
    
    UI --> BL
    BL --> EXT
    BL --> MID
    MID --> EXT
```

## Implementation Approach

The implementation of the restructured DESIGN.md will proceed as follows:

1. Create a new version of DESIGN.md with the structure outlined above
2. Copy relevant content from the current DESIGN.md to appropriate sections
3. Add new content as specified (diagrams, clearer explanations)
4. Update cross-references to maintain document integrity
5. Review for completeness to ensure no content is lost

## Content Preservation and Migration

The restructuring will ensure:
- All existing content is preserved
- Content is placed in the most appropriate section
- Cross-references to other documents are maintained
- New content enhances rather than replaces existing documentation
