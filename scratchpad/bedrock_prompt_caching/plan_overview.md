# Bedrock Prompt Caching Implementation Plan

⚠️ CRITICAL: CODING ASSISTANT MUST READ THESE DOCUMENTATION FILES COMPLETELY BEFORE EXECUTING ANY TASKS IN THIS PLAN

## Documentation References

- `src/dbp/llm/bedrock/base.py`: Core implementation of Bedrock API integration
- `src/dbp/llm/bedrock/enhanced_base.py`: Extended functionality with capability-based model features
- `src/dbp/llm/common/base.py`: Abstract base classes for LLM clients
- `src/dbp/llm/bedrock/models/claude3.py`: Example of a specific model implementation
- `src/dbp/llm/bedrock/discovery/models.py`: Model discovery and metadata

## Background

Amazon Bedrock has introduced prompt caching to optimize LLM interactions by caching repetitive inputs. This feature can reduce costs by up to 90% and latency by up to 85%, but is only supported by specific models (Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Nova series, etc.). 

Prompt caching works by:
1. Marking cache checkpoints in prompts
2. When a subsequent request contains the same cached prefix, the LLM reads from the cache
3. This avoids reprocessing identical input tokens

For maximum effectiveness, static content should be placed at the beginning of prompts and dynamic content at the end.

## Requirements

1. Expose an accessor to check if a specific model supports Bedrock prompt caching
2. Expose an API to enable prompt caching for a given conversation with a model
3. Expose an API to mark cache points during a given conversation with a model

All APIs should succeed without errors even if the model doesn't support prompt caching.

## Integration Approach

We'll integrate prompt caching support into the existing architecture by:

1. Enhancing the capability system to include prompt caching as a model capability
2. Implementing model detection for prompt caching support
3. Adding configuration options to enable/disable caching
4. Creating APIs to mark cache points in conversations
5. Modifying request formation to include caching parameters
6. Updating documentation and adding examples

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Model Capability System Enhancement**
   - Add prompt caching as a model capability
   - Implement model detection for prompt caching support
   - Update model discovery to identify which models support caching

2. **Phase 2: Core API Implementation**
   - Implement enable_prompt_caching API
   - Implement mark_cache_point API for conversation cache points
   - Update request formatting to include caching configuration

3. **Phase 3: Model-Specific Integration**
   - Update ClaudeClient and other model clients to register caching capability
   - Add model-specific optimizations for caching (if needed)

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Documentation**
   - Create example usage for all new APIs
   - Add documentation for the prompt caching feature
   - Create a verification script

## Compatibility Considerations

- The implementation must be backward compatible with existing code
- APIs must succeed gracefully when used with models that don't support caching
- The approach should leverage the existing capability system
- The implementation should follow project coding standards and documentation requirements
