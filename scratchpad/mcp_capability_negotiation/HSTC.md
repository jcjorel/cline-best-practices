# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: mcp_capability_negotiation

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains implementation planning documents for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) capability negotiation feature. It's a scratchpad area holding architectural plans, design documents, and implementation strategies focused on enhancing the MCP protocol with standardized capability discovery and negotiation mechanisms. These documents outline how clients and servers can dynamically discover each other's supported features, negotiate compatible protocol versions, and gracefully handle feature mismatches. The content serves as planning material rather than production code, providing a roadmap for implementing the capability negotiation protocol.
