# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: scripts

## Directory Purpose
The scripts directory contains utility scripts for system maintenance, debugging, dependency analysis, and validation that support the development and operation of the Documentation-Based Programming system. These scripts are designed to be run from the command line rather than being imported as modules, providing tools for developers to perform common maintenance tasks, validate system integrity, and troubleshoot issues. The scripts follow consistent patterns for argument parsing, error handling, and output formatting to ensure usability across different environments.
