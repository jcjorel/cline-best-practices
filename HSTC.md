# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: cline-best-practices

## Directory Purpose
This project implements a Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system, which is an architecture that uses documentation as a primary project asset. The system ensures consistency between code and documentation, provides rich context for AI tools, and enforces project standards through automated analysis and recommendations. It includes components for configuration management, file system monitoring, documentation relationship tracking, consistency analysis, metadata extraction, and LLM integration for intelligent assistance and automation.

## Child Directories

### scratchpad
This directory contains temporary working files and implementation plans for the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. It serves as a workspace for planning complex changes before implementation and stores ephemeral documents that are not considered authoritative sources.

### src
This directory contains the source code implementation of the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. The source code is organized into packages and modules that implement the core functionality, integrations, utilities, and command-line interfaces for the DBP system. The primary package is dbp, which contains the core components for configuration management, filesystem monitoring, document relationship tracking, consistency analysis, metadata extraction, LLM coordination, and MCP server functionality. The implementation follows a component-based architecture with standardized lifecycle management, dependency injection, and proper separation of concerns.

### doc
This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. It follows the DBP methodology with structured markdown files that define the system architecture, APIs, configuration options, data models, security considerations, and other important aspects of the system. The documentation serves as a single source of truth for the project and is designed to maintain consistency with the codebase through automated analysis and tracking of relationships between documentation files.

### scripts
This directory contains utility scripts for system administration, debugging, testing, and maintenance of the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. These scripts are designed to be executed directly from the command line and provide functionality for log analysis, component dependency checking, server debugging, and validation of component refactoring efforts. They help maintain and troubleshoot the DBP system outside the main application framework.

### coding_assistant
This directory contains tools, utilities, and scripts that support the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system, primarily focused on integration with AI coding assistants. It includes templates for code documentation, logging infrastructure, database support files, and utility scripts for HSTC management and other maintenance tasks. The components in this directory enhance developer productivity by automating routine tasks and maintaining documentation consistency.
