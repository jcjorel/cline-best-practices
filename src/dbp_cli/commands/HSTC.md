# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: commands

## Directory Purpose
The commands directory implements the command-line interface (CLI) commands for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It provides a set of executable commands that users can invoke through the dbp_cli tool to interact with various system features. Each command follows a consistent structure with argument parsing, execution logic, and output formatting. The commands are designed to be user-friendly, with clear help messages, error handling, and consistent return codes. This directory organizes commands in a modular fashion, making it easy to add new functionality to the CLI.
