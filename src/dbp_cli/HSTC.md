# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: dbp_cli

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the command-line interface (CLI) for the Document Based Programming (DBP) system. It provides a user-friendly command-line tool for interacting with DBP features, including connection to the MCP server, authentication, configuration management, and execution of various commands. The CLI architecture follows a modular design with command handlers organized in the commands subdirectory, a central API client for MCP server communication, and shared utilities for output formatting, authentication, configuration access, and progress indication.

## Local Files

### `__main__.py`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  Entry point for the DBP CLI application when run as a module. It initializes
  the CLI parser and delegates to the appropriate command handler.
  
source_file_design_principles: |
  - Simple entry point for CLI execution
  - Centralizes CLI initialization and error handling
  - Provides clean error messages for user-facing failures
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Must handle all uncaught exceptions gracefully
  - Must provide appropriate exit codes
  - Should be minimal and delegate to cli.py for actual functionality
  
dependencies:
  - kind: codebase
    dependency: src/dbp_cli/cli.py

```

### `api.py`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  Implements the MCPClientAPI class, which acts as the client-side interface
  for communicating with the DBP MCP server. It handles constructing HTTP requests
  based on MCP tool/resource calls, sending them to the configured server URL,
  handling authentication headers, and processing the MCP responses (including errors).
  
source_file_design_principles: |
  - Abstracts HTTP request/response logic for MCP communication.
  - Uses the `requests` library for making HTTP calls.
  - Integrates with `AuthenticationManager` to get necessary auth headers.
  - Provides specific methods for common DBP operations (analyze, recommend, etc.),
    which map to corresponding MCP tool/resource calls.
  - Handles common HTTP errors and MCP-specific errors returned by the server.
  - Includes configurable timeout for requests.
  - Design Decision: Dedicated API Client Class (2025-04-15)
    * Rationale: Encapsulates all server communication logic, making command handlers cleaner and simplifying testing of API interactions.
    * Alternatives considered: Making HTTP requests directly in command handlers (less reusable, mixes concerns).
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Requires the `requests` library (`pip install requests`).
  - Depends on `AuthenticationManager` for auth headers.
  - Depends on `ConfigurationManager` for server URL and timeout.
  - Relies on the MCP server adhering to the expected request/response formats.
  - Error handling maps HTTP/MCP errors to CLI-specific exceptions.

  - timestamp: "2025-04-26T11:08:00Z"
    summary: "Modified API key handling to wait for 401 response"
    details: "Updated _make_request() to first attempt requests without authentication, added logic to only fetch API key when server returns 401 Unauthorized, modified error handling to provide clear messages when authentication is required, improved API key usage efficiency by avoiding unnecessary key lookups"
  - timestamp: "2025-04-25T10:10:00Z"
    summary: "Updated to use get_typed_config() instead of deprecated get() method"
    details: "Replaced config_manager.get() calls with direct attribute access via get_typed_config(), fixed server startup error related to deprecated method exception, updated configuration access to follow new type-safe pattern"
