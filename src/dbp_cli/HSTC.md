# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: dbp_cli

## Directory Purpose
The dbp_cli directory implements the command-line interface for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It provides a user-friendly CLI for interacting with the system's functionality through structured commands, argument parsing, and formatted output. This module serves as the primary user interface for tasks like updating HSTC files, analyzing documentation consistency, managing document relationships, and configuring the system. The implementation follows a modular command pattern, where each command is implemented as a separate module with consistent interfaces.

## Child Directories

### commands
Contains implementations of specific CLI commands that can be executed by the user, each following a consistent structure with argument parsing, execution logic, and output formatting.
