# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: doc_relationships

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the documentation relationship management subsystem of the DBP system. It provides components for analyzing, tracking, and visualizing relationships between documentation files and between documentation and code. The system enables impact analysis to understand how changes in one document affect others, builds relationship graphs for visualization, detects changes in document relationships over time, and provides query capabilities for exploring documentation connections. This functionality is critical for maintaining consistency across the documentation ecosystem.
