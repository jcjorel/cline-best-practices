### Filename 'component.py':
**Intent:** Implements the DocRelationshipsComponent class, the main component responsible for managing and analyzing relationships between documentation files within the DBP system. It conforms to the Component protocol and integrates the graph, repository, analyzer, visualizer, and query interface for document relationships.

**Design principles:**
- Conforms to the Component protocol (`src/dbp/core/component.py`).
- Encapsulates the documentation relationship subsystem.
- Declares dependencies (e.g., 'database', 'metadata_extraction').
- Initializes internal parts (repository, graph, analyzer, etc.) during `initialize`.
- Loads existing relationships from the database on startup.
- Provides public methods for analyzing relationships, finding impacts, detecting changes, querying relationships, and generating visualizations.
- Design Decision: Component Facade for Doc Relationships (2025-04-15)
  * Rationale: Groups all relationship-related logic into a single manageable component.
  * Alternatives considered: Exposing individual parts (more complex integration).

**Constraints:**
- Depends on the core component framework and other components like 'database'.
- Requires all helper classes within the `doc_relationships` package.
- Assumes configuration is available via InitializationContext.
- Performance of analysis and loading depends on the number of documents and relationships.

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-20T01:24:15Z : Completed dependency injection refactoring
- 2025-04-20T00:13:01Z : Added dependency injection support

### Filename 'data_models.py':
**Intent:** Defines the core data structures (using dataclasses) for representing relationships between documentation files, the impact of changes, and the details of those changes within the DBP system.

**Design principles:**
- Uses standard Python dataclasses for clear and lightweight data representation.
- Defines structures for relationships, impacts, and change impacts.
- Includes type hints for clarity and static analysis.
- Aligns with the data models specified in the Documentation Relationships design plan.

**Constraints:**

**Design principles:**
- Focused solely on relationship extraction from document content
- Uses pattern matching and semantic analysis techniques
- Extracts relationship types, topics, and scopes based on context
- Handles different document formats (e.g., markdown, code with comments)
- Design Decision: Separate Analysis from Storage (2025-04-15)

**Constraints:**
- Memory usage scales with the number of documents and relationships
- Must remain synchronized with the persistent storage
- Requires adequate indexing for performance with large graphs

**Intent:** Implements the ImpactAnalyzer class responsible for determining which documents would be affected by changes to a specific document. It leverages the relationship graph to trace potential impact paths.

**Design principles:**
- Utilizes graph traversal algorithms for impact analysis
- Calculates impact levels based on relationship types and path distances
- Provides full impact chains including indirect effects
- Supports both forward and reverse impact analysis
- Design Decision: Separate Impact and Change Detection (2025-04-15)
  * Rationale: Allows general impact analysis without specific change details
  * Alternatives considered: Combined change and impact analysis (less flexibility)

**Constraints:**
- Depends on RelationshipGraph for document connection data
- Performance is affected by graph size and complexity
- Accuracy depends on the completeness of relationship data

### Filename 'change_detector.py':
**Intent:** Implements the ChangeDetector class that identifies specific changes between versions of a document and determines their potential impacts on related documents. It combines document diff analysis with relationship impact assessment.

**Design principles:**
- Uses semantic diff techniques to identify meaningful changes
- Categorizes changes by type and significance
- Maps specific changes to potential impacts on related documents
- Integrates with ImpactAnalyzer for relationship traversal
- Design Decision: Change-Specific Impact Analysis (2025-04-15)
