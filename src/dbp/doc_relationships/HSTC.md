# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: doc_relationships

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the Document Relationships component for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It analyzes, stores, and manages relationships between documentation files throughout the codebase. The component builds and maintains a graph representation of these relationships, enabling consistency analysis, impact assessment, change detection, and visualization. This knowledge of document dependencies is critical for maintaining documentation consistency when either code or documentation files are modified, helping to identify what other documents might be affected by changes.

    querying relationships, and generating visualizations.
