# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: database

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the database subsystem for the DBP application, providing persistent storage capabilities through both SQLite and PostgreSQL database backends. It includes components for database connection management, session handling, schema management, data models, and repository access patterns. The database architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation between connection management (database.py), schema migrations (alembic_manager.py), data models (models.py), and data access repositories (repositories.py). This subsystem implements thread-safe database access with connection pooling, transaction management, retry logic for transient errors, and automated schema migrations using Alembic.

### `alembic_manager.py`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  Implements the AlembicManager class responsible for managing database schema migrations
  using the Alembic migration tool. It handles versioning, schema upgrades, and migration tracking.
  
source_file_design_principles: |
  - Encapsulates Alembic-specific migration logic
  - Provides clean interface for running migrations
  - Separates migration concerns from general database management
  - Handles configuration and environment setup for Alembic
  - Ensures database schema stays in sync with application models
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Requires Alembic library
  - Depends on SQLAlchemy database engine
  - Assumes migration scripts exist in the alembic directory

    details: "Extracted Alembic migration code from database.py into dedicated manager class"
```

### `database.py`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  Provides a DatabaseManager class responsible for initializing, managing, and
  providing access to the database (SQLite or PostgreSQL) used by the DBP system.
  It handles connection pooling, session management, schema initialization, and retries.
  
source_file_design_principles: |
  - Encapsulates database connection logic.
  - Supports configurable database backends (SQLite default, PostgreSQL).
  - Ensures thread-safe database access using scoped sessions.
  - Implements connection pooling for efficiency.
  - Delegates schema management to AlembicManager.
  - Provides context manager for session handling (commit/rollback).
  - Includes retry logic for transient operational errors.
  - Design Decision: Centralized Database Manager (2025-04-13)
    * Rationale: Consolidates database setup and access logic, simplifying component interactions with the database.
    * Alternatives considered: Direct engine/session creation in each component (rejected for complexity and inconsistency).
  - Design Decision: Support SQLite and PostgreSQL (2025-04-13)
    * Rationale: Offers flexibility for different deployment scenarios (simple local vs. robust server).
    * Alternatives considered: SQLite only (rejected for scalability concerns), PostgreSQL only (rejected for lack of simple default).
  - Design Decision: Separated Migration Functionality (2025-04-18)
    * Rationale: Reduces code complexity by isolating Alembic-specific migration code in a dedicated class.
    * Alternatives considered: Keeping migration code in database.py (rejected due to large file size and complexity).
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Requires configuration object providing database settings.
  - Depends on SQLAlchemy library.
  - Assumes `models.py` defines the `Base` and `SchemaVersion` model.
  - Schema migration is handled by AlembicManager.

## Child Directories

### repositories
This directory implements specific repository classes for each entity type in the system, extending the BaseRepository class with model-specific query methods, business logic, and advanced data access patterns. Each repository class is responsible for a specific entity type and provides a clean, domain-specific interface for accessing and manipulating that entity's data while encapsulating the underlying database operations and queries.

### alembic
This directory contains Alembic migration scripts and configuration for managing database schema migrations. Alembic tracks database schema versions and provides a way to upgrade or downgrade the schema based on migration scripts. It includes version control for schema changes, ensuring consistent database structure across different environments and installations.
