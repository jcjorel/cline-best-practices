### Filename 'database.py':
**Intent:** Provides a DatabaseManager class responsible for initializing, managing, and providing access to the database (SQLite or PostgreSQL) used by the DBP system. It handles connection pooling, session management, schema initialization, and retries.

**Design principles:**
- Encapsulates database connection logic.
- Supports configurable database backends (SQLite default, PostgreSQL).
- Ensures thread-safe database access using scoped sessions.
- Implements connection pooling for efficiency.
- Delegates schema management to AlembicManager.
- Provides context manager for session handling (commit/rollback).
- Includes retry logic for transient operational errors.
- Design Decision: Centralized Database Manager (2025-04-13)
  * Rationale: Consolidates database setup and access logic, simplifying component interactions with the database.
  * Alternatives considered: Direct engine/session creation in each component (rejected for complexity and inconsistency).
- Design Decision: Support SQLite and PostgreSQL (2025-04-13)
  * Rationale: Offers flexibility for different deployment scenarios (simple local vs. robust server).
  * Alternatives considered: SQLite only (rejected for scalability concerns), PostgreSQL only (rejected for lack of simple default).
- Design Decision: Separated Migration Functionality (2025-04-18)
  * Rationale: Reduces code complexity by isolating Alembic-specific migration code in a dedicated class.
  * Alternatives considered: Keeping migration code in database.py (rejected due to large file size and complexity).

**Constraints:**
- Requires configuration object providing database settings.
- Depends on SQLAlchemy library.
- Assumes `models.py` defines the `Base` and `SchemaVersion` model.
- Schema migration is handled by AlembicManager.

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-19T23:52:00Z : Added dependency injection support
- 2025-04-18T10:54:00Z : Refactored to use AlembicManager for migrations
- 2025-04-18T09:31:00Z : Modified Alembic to throw errors without fallbacks
- 2025-04-18T08:15:00Z : Fixed database URL configuration in Alembic setup

### Filename 'alembic_manager.py':
**Intent:** Provides specialized functionality for managing database schema migrations using Alembic. Extracts this responsibility from the main DatabaseManager to improve maintainability.

**Design principles:**
- Separates Alembic migration concerns from core database connection management.
- Implements strict error handling with proper exceptions (no silent failures).
- Provides detailed logging during migration operations for troubleshooting.
- Supports configurable verbosity for migration operations.
- Design Decision: Centralized Migration Management (2025-04-18)
  * Rationale: Separates complex migration logic from core database functionality.
  * Alternatives considered: Keeping migration code in database.py (rejected due to complexity).

**Constraints:**
- Requires Alembic library to be installed.
- Depends on SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
- Requires configuration object providing database and migration settings.
- Needs access to a database engine and session manager.

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T10:51:00Z : Created alembic_manager.py by extracting from database.py

### Filename 'models.py':
**Intent:** Defines SQLAlchemy ORM models that represent the database schema for the DBP system. Provides the base class for all models and specific entity models required by the system.

**Design principles:**
- Uses SQLAlchemy's declarative base pattern for ORM models
- Organizes model relationships through SQLAlchemy relationships and foreign keys
- Includes essential metadata for auditing (created_at, updated_at)
- Provides serialization hooks for API responses
- Design Decision: Centralized Models Definition (2025-04-13)
  * Rationale: Having models in one place simplifies schema management and migrations
  * Alternatives considered: Distributed models across components (rejected for fragmentation)

**Constraints:**
- Requires SQLAlchemy ORM
- Must maintain backward compatibility for schema changes
- Relationships should be defined with appropriate cascade behaviors
- Schema changes require corresponding Alembic migrations

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T10:45:00Z : Added SchemaVersion model for tracking migrations
- 2025-04-17T14:28:00Z : Enhanced relationship models with cascade behaviors
- 2025-04-16T09:32:00Z : Added database models for document relationships
- 2025-04-15T10:36:00Z : Created initial SQLAlchemy model definitions

### Filename 'repositories.py':
**Intent:** Implements the Repository pattern to provide data access objects (DAOs) for database operations, abstracting SQLAlchemy operations behind domain-specific interfaces.

**Design principles:**
- Implements Repository pattern for clean separation of concerns
- Provides common CRUD operations through a base repository
- Specializes repositories for different entity types
- Includes transaction and error handling
- Design Decision: Repository Pattern (2025-04-13)
  * Rationale: Isolates database operations from business logic, making code more testable
  * Alternatives considered: Direct use of SQLAlchemy sessions (rejected for lack of abstraction)

**Constraints:**
- Depends on models.py for ORM model definitions
- Depends on SQLAlchemy for database operations
- Repository methods should be thread-safe
- Should not contain business logic, only data access operations

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T16:32:00Z : Added batch operations for improved performance
- 2025-04-17T14:45:00Z : Enhanced filtering capabilities with pagination

- 2025-04-15T11:20:00Z : Created initial repository implementations

### Filename 'base_repository.py':
**Intent:** Provides a flexible, reusable base class for implementing the Repository pattern with SQLAlchemy. This reduces boilerplate code for common CRUD operations across different entity repositories.

**Design principles:**
- Highly reusable template for repository implementations
- Type-parametrized to work with any SQLAlchemy model
- Includes standard CRUD operations plus common query patterns
- Implements proper error handling and transaction management
- Design Decision: Generic Base Repository (2025-04-13)
  * Rationale: Reduces code duplication across repositories while maintaining flexibility
  * Alternatives considered: Multiple specialized base repositories (rejected for duplication)

**Constraints:**
- Depends on SQLAlchemy ORM
- Designed to work with Session objects from database.py
- Assumes models follow standard attribute patterns
- Repository methods should not expose SQLAlchemy-specific details

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T13:15:00Z : Added pagination support for get_all and find_by methods

### Filename 'change_record_repository.py':
**Intent:** Implements a specialized repository for tracking and accessing change records within the DBP system. These records represent documented changes to files, code, or other system artifacts.

**Design principles:**
- Extends BaseRepository with change-specific query methods
- Includes specialized filtering for change record types
- Implements efficient batch operations for change records
- Provides methods for historical and timeline-based queries
- Design Decision: Specialized Change Repository (2025-04-13)

**Constraints:**
- Depends on ChangeRecord model definition
- Designed for frequent write operations (adding changes)
- Must handle potentially large volumes of change records
- Requires efficient indexing and query optimization

- Includes search capabilities for document content and metadata
- Implements versioning and revision history for documents
- Provides methods for hierarchical document navigation
- Design Decision: Document Versioning System (2025-04-13)

  * Alternatives considered: Simple document updates (rejected for lack of history)

**Constraints:**
- Depends on Document and DocumentVersion models
- Must handle potentially large document content efficiently
- Requires proper transaction handling for multi-step operations
- Should maintain document integrity across operations
