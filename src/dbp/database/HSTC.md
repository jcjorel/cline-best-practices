# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: database

## Directory Purpose
The database directory implements the data persistence layer for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It provides database connectivity, schema definition, migrations, and data access abstractions for storing and retrieving system information. This component is built using SQLAlchemy with support for different database backends (primarily SQLite for ease of deployment). It follows a repository pattern to provide clean separation between database implementation details and the business logic of other components that need to persist data.

## Child Directories

### alembic
Contains database migration scripts and configuration for evolving the database schema over time using Alembic.

### repositories
Implements repository pattern classes for different data entities, providing data access abstractions to other system components.
