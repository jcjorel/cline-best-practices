# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: database

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains the database layer of the DBP system, responsible for data persistence, schema management, and database interactions. It implements a robust ORM architecture using SQLAlchemy, with separate components for database connection handling, model definitions, migration management, and data access repositories. The architecture follows the repository pattern to abstract database operations and provides a comprehensive set of repositories for different entity types, supporting schema evolution through Alembic-managed migrations.

## Child Directories

### alembic
This directory contains the Alembic database migration framework configuration and scripts for the DBP system. Alembic provides a structured way to manage database schema changes over time, ensuring proper version control and upgrade/downgrade paths. The directory includes migration templates, environment configuration, and version scripts organized into subdirectories that collectively enable controlled database schema evolution.

### repositories
This directory contains repository classes that implement the data access layer for the DBP system. Following the repository pattern, these classes provide a clean abstraction for database operations, encapsulating SQL queries and database interactions. Each repository specializes in handling specific entity types, offering CRUD operations and specialized queries while maintaining separation between business logic and data persistence concerns. The repositories collectively provide a comprehensive interface for all database interactions across the system.
