# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: versions

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains Alembic version migration scripts for the DBP system database. Each file represents a specific database schema migration that tracks changes to the database structure over time. The version scripts are generated by Alembic and follow a naming pattern with a version identifier prefix. These scripts enable controlled, reversible database schema evolution including creating, modifying, and removing tables, columns, indexes, and constraints.
