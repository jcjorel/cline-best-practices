# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: versions

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains Alembic migration scripts that define database schema changes for the Documentation-Based Programming system. These versioned migration files enable systematic database schema evolution while preserving data integrity. Each migration script represents a discrete change to the database schema, with a timestamp-based naming convention ensuring sequential execution.
