# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: alembic

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains the Alembic database migration framework configuration and scripts for the DBP system. Alembic provides a structured way to manage database schema changes over time, ensuring proper version control and upgrade/downgrade paths. The directory includes migration templates, environment configuration, and version scripts organized into subdirectories that collectively enable controlled database schema evolution.

## Child Directories

### versions
This directory contains Alembic version migration scripts for the DBP system database. Each file represents a specific database schema migration that tracks changes to the database structure over time. The version scripts are generated by Alembic and follow a naming pattern with a version identifier prefix. These scripts enable controlled, reversible database schema evolution including creating, modifying, and removing tables, columns, indexes, and constraints.
