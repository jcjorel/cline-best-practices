### Filename 'env.py':
**Intent:** Configures the Alembic environment and provides integration with SQLAlchemy models for automatic migration generation. This file is executed by Alembic during migration operations.

**Design principles:**
- Centralizes Alembic configuration settings
- Provides access to SQLAlchemy models and metadata
- Configures connection handling for migrations
- Implements logging for migration operations
- Enables transaction management during schema changes

**Constraints:**
- Must have access to SQLAlchemy models
- Requires configuration for database URL
- Depends on Alembic library
- Must handle both online and offline migration modes

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T11:15:00Z : Enhanced logging during migration operations
- 2025-04-18T10:30:00Z : Added SQLAlchemy model integration improvements
- 2025-04-18T09:25:00Z : Configured transaction handling
- 2025-04-17T16:45:00Z : Created initial Alembic environment setup

### Filename 'script.py.mako':
**Intent:** Provides a template for Alembic to generate new migration script files. This template defines the structure and format of migration scripts.

**Design principles:**
- Standardizes migration script format
- Includes placeholders for upgrade and downgrade operations
- Provides imports for commonly used SQLAlchemy operations
- Enables revision tracking and dependencies
- Ensures migrations are timestamped and properly documented

**Constraints:**
- Must follow Mako template syntax
- Requires standard Alembic revision format
- Should include proper imports for SQLAlchemy operations
- Must support both upgrade and downgrade operations

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T11:20:00Z : Enhanced template with additional documentation
- 2025-04-18T10:35:00Z : Added standard error handling patterns
- 2025-04-17T16:50:00Z : Created initial migration script template

### Filename 'README.md':
**Intent:** Provides documentation and guidance on using Alembic for database migrations within the DBP system. Includes usage instructions, best practices, and directory structure information.

**Design principles:**
- Clearly documents migration workflow
- Provides examples of common migration operations
- Includes best practices for database schema changes
- Explains directory structure and file purposes
- Serves as a quick reference for developers

**Constraints:**
- Should be kept updated with any workflow changes
- Must include essential commands for common operations
- Should align with broader project documentation standards
- Focuses on practical usage rather than exhaustive details

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-19T09:30:00Z : Added best practices section
- 2025-04-18T14:20:00Z : Enhanced migration creation instructions
- 2025-04-18T11:45:00Z : Updated directory structure documentation
- 2025-04-17T17:10:00Z : Created initial migration documentation
