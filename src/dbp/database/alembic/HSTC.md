# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: alembic

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains the Alembic database migration infrastructure for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It manages database schema creation, updates, and versioning in a controlled manner through migration scripts. The environment is configured to integrate with the application's configuration system while supporting both online database updates and offline SQL script generation. This infrastructure ensures database schema changes are tracked, versioned, and can be applied or rolled back systematically across development, testing, and production environments.

## Child Directories

### versions
This directory contains Alembic migration scripts that define database schema changes for the Documentation-Based Programming system. These versioned migration files enable systematic database schema evolution while preserving data integrity. Each migration script represents a discrete change to the database schema, with a timestamp-based naming convention ensuring sequential execution.
