# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: repositories

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the Repository pattern for the DBP system, providing data access abstractions for each entity type in the database. It contains specialized repository classes that encapsulate database operations, ensuring consistent error handling and transaction management. Each repository focuses on a specific entity type, offering CRUD operations and specialized queries, while centralizing common functionality in a base class to promote code reuse and maintainable database interaction.
