# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: repositories

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains repository implementation classes that follow the Repository pattern to provide a clean data access abstraction layer for the DBP system. Each repository handles database operations for a specific entity type, encapsulating SQL operations and transactions. The repositories are designed to be used by other components to access and manipulate data without directly dealing with database-specific code, providing a consistent interface for data access across the application.
