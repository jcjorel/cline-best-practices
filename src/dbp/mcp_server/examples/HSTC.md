# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: examples

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains example implementations and reference code for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server components. It provides sample code for tools, resources, and client interactions that demonstrate proper implementation patterns for the MCP API. These examples serve as educational resources and templates for developers implementing their own MCP tools and resources, illustrating best practices for inheritance, model definition, execution patterns, and registration with the FastMCP framework.
