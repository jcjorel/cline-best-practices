# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: mcp_server

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration for the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. It provides a complete MCP server implementation that enables AI assistants to interact with the DBP system through standardized tools and resources. The MCP server exposes functionality for document relationships analysis, consistency checking, and recommendation generation to AI assistants while maintaining proper authentication and authorization controls. The implementation follows the component architecture of the DBP system and integrates with its lifecycle management.

## Child Directories

### internal_tools
This directory implements specialized MCP tools that expose DBP system capabilities to AI assistants through the MCP protocol. It contains implementations for consistency checking, document relationship visualization, recommendation generation, and other internal functionality that can be accessed via the MCP interface. The tools follow a standardized base implementation pattern and are designed to be easily registered with the MCP server component.
