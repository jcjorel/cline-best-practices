# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: mcp_server

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server component for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It provides the infrastructure to expose DBP functionality as MCP tools and resources, enabling LLM assistants to interact with the system via a standardized API. The component integrates with the core DBP framework, manages server lifecycle, handles authentication and authorization, provides error handling, and maintains registries of tools and resources. The implementation follows a clean architecture that separates protocols, adapters, server logic, and tool/resource implementations.

## Child Directories

### internal_tools
This directory contains internal implementation classes for the MCP server tools that are not directly exposed to clients. These internal tools provide the underlying functionality for public-facing MCP tools defined elsewhere. Each tool follows a consistent interface pattern with proper separation between public and internal concerns, enabling maintainable code with clear boundaries while implementing various analysis and functionality capabilities.
