# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: config

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains components responsible for configuration management in the Documentation-Based Programming (DBP) system. It implements a layered configuration approach with a singleton ConfigurationManager that loads settings from multiple sources (defaults, files, environment variables, CLI args), validates them using Pydantic models, and provides type-safe access. The ConfigManagerComponent acts as an adapter between the ConfigurationManager singleton and the component lifecycle framework, making configuration available to other components via the registry.
