# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: config

## Directory Purpose
The config directory implements the configuration management system for the Documentation-Based Programming platform. It provides a unified approach to managing configuration settings from different sources (environment variables, configuration files, command line arguments) with validation, defaults, and schema enforcement. This component follows a hierarchical configuration model where system defaults can be overridden by project-specific settings and environment-specific overrides. The implementation uses a component-based approach for integration with the rest of the system.
