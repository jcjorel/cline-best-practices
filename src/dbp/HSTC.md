# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: dbp

## Directory Purpose
The dbp directory implements the core functionality of the Documentation-Based Programming system. It follows a modular architecture where each major concern is encapsulated in a dedicated component with well-defined interfaces and responsibilities. This module provides capabilities for document analysis, consistency checking, document relationship tracking, metadata extraction, file system monitoring, database management, and LLM integration. Components follow a consistent lifecycle pattern for initialization, dependency resolution, and graceful shutdown, enabling robust system operation.

## Child Directories

### config
Provides configuration management for the entire system, including schema definitions, default values, component-specific configurations, and CLI-based configuration tools.

### consistency_analysis
Implements functionality for analyzing consistency between documentation files and code, identifying discrepancies, and generating reports on potential issues requiring attention.

### core
Contains core infrastructure shared across all components, including the component registry, lifecycle management, file access utilities, and logging infrastructure.

### database
Manages database connectivity, models, migrations, and repositories for persistent storage of system data including document relationships and analysis results.

### doc_relationships
Implements tracking and analysis of relationships between documentation files, including graph-based representation, change detection, and impact analysis.

### fs_monitor
Provides file system monitoring capabilities with platform-specific implementations, change filtering, and event queuing for documentation and code changes.

### internal_tools
Implements internal tools for code and document analysis, LLM interaction, context assembly, and other utilities used across the system.

### llm
Contains implementation of LLM client interfaces, prompt management, and specialized clients for different model providers like Claude and Nova.

### llm_coordinator
Coordinates LLM operations across the system, including job management, request handling, and response formatting for consistency.

### mcp_server
Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server component for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It provides the infrastructure to expose DBP functionality as MCP tools and resources, enabling LLM assistants to interact with the system via a standardized API. The component integrates with the core DBP framework, manages server lifecycle, handles authentication and authorization, provides error handling, and maintains registries of tools and resources. The implementation follows a clean architecture that separates protocols, adapters, server logic, and tool/resource implementations.

### memory_cache
Provides in-memory caching capabilities for document analysis results, with indexing, eviction strategies, and synchronization mechanisms.

### metadata_extraction
Implements extraction of metadata from documentation and code files, including semantic analysis and structure identification.

### recommendation_generator
Generates recommendations for documentation improvements based on consistency analysis and document relationship insights.

### scheduler
Implements background task scheduling for system maintenance, periodic analysis, and asynchronous operations.
