# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: dispatch

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the event dispatching subsystem of the fs_monitor component in the DBP system. It provides mechanisms for processing file system events, including debouncing to prevent notification storms, thread management for efficient event handling, and event routing to interested listeners. The dispatch system serves as the central hub for event processing, coordinating between platform-specific file system monitors and application-level event listeners.

```yaml
source_file_intent: |
