# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: fs_monitor

## Directory Purpose
The fs_monitor directory implements file system monitoring capabilities with cross-platform support for detecting changes to documentation and code files. It provides efficient event detection and filtering mechanisms to track file creation, modification, deletion, and movement within project directories. This component is designed with platform-specific optimizations for Windows, macOS, and Linux, with a fallback implementation for unsupported platforms. The module follows a factory pattern to select the appropriate implementation based on the current operating system while maintaining a consistent interface for consumers.
