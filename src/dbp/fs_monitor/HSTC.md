# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: fs_monitor

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the file system monitoring subsystem for the DBP application, providing real-time tracking of file system changes across different operating system platforms. It uses a hierarchical architecture that separates platform-specific monitoring implementations from event dispatching and listening interfaces. The system supports multiple concurrent file watchers, thread-safe event dispatching, and pattern-based filtering. It includes a fallback polling mechanism for environments where native file system monitoring APIs are unavailable and implements debouncing to prevent event storms during rapid file changes.

## Child Directories

### core
This directory contains core abstractions, interfaces, and data structures for the file system monitoring subsystem. It defines the essential building blocks like event types, listener interfaces, and shared utilities that are used throughout the subsystem. The core module provides a foundation of consistent data types that enable the platform-specific implementations and dispatch mechanisms to interoperate seamlessly.

### dispatch
This directory implements the event dispatching system for file system events. It manages a thread pool for concurrent event processing, implements event debouncing to prevent event storms, and provides an execution context for event listeners. The dispatch subsystem ensures that file system events are delivered to registered listeners in a reliable and efficient manner, while managing thread priorities and resource utilization.

### platforms
This directory contains platform-specific implementations of file system monitoring for different operating systems. It provides a common interface that abstracts away the underlying OS-specific monitoring APIs (such as inotify on Linux, FSEvents on macOS, and ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows), along with a polling-based fallback implementation for environments where native APIs are not available or accessible. The factory pattern allows the system to select the appropriate monitor implementation for the current platform.
