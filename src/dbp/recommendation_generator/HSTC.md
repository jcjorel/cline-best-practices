### Filename 'component.py':
**Intent:** Implements the RecommendationGeneratorComponent class which serves as the main entry point for generating recommendations based on project metadata and analysis. This component coordinates the recommendation generation process and integrates with other system components.

**Design principles:**
- Conforms to the Component protocol (src/dbp/core/component.py)
- Orchestrates the recommendation generation workflow
- Delegates specific operations to specialized services
- Provides a clean interface for other components
- Integrates with notification systems for delivering recommendations

**Constraints:**
- Depends on metadata analysis and database components
- Must prioritize recommendations effectively
- Should not generate excessive recommendations
- Requires appropriate configuration for recommendation strategies

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-19T17:30:00Z : Added dependency injection support
- 2025-04-18T16:15:00Z : Initial creation of RecommendationGeneratorComponent

### Filename 'data_models.py':
**Intent:** Defines the data structures and models used throughout the recommendation generation subsystem. These structures represent recommendation types, priorities, contexts, and user feedback.

**Design principles:**
- Strong typing for all recommendation structures
- Clear categorization of recommendation types
- Support for priority levels and metadata
- Serialization support for persistence

**Constraints:**
- Must support versioning for schema evolution
- Should include user feedback mechanisms
- Must define clear validation rules

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T16:30:00Z : Initial creation of recommendation data models

### Filename 'engine.py':
**Intent:** Implements the RecommendationEngine class that powers the core recommendation generation logic. This engine analyzes metadata and context to produce valuable recommendations according to configured strategies.

**Design principles:**
- Rule-based recommendation generation
- Pluggable strategy system for different recommendation types
- Context-aware recommendation relevance scoring
- Support for user preference learning

**Constraints:**
- Must generate valuable, actionable recommendations
- Should avoid recommendation fatigue (too many suggestions)
- Must incorporate user feedback to improve over time
- Recommendations should include clear rationale

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T17:00:00Z : Initial implementation of recommendation engine

### Filename 'feedback.py':
**Intent:** Implements the FeedbackProcessor class that handles user feedback on recommendations. This includes tracking acceptance, rejection, and modifications to improve future recommendations.

**Design principles:**
- Comprehensive feedback tracking system
- Support for different feedback types
- Learning from feedback patterns
- Privacy-respecting feedback collection

**Constraints:**
- Must handle feedback data securely
- Should integrate with the recommendation scoring system
- Must persist feedback for long-term learning
- Should respect user preferences for feedback collection

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T19:30:00Z : Initial implementation of feedback processor

### Filename 'formatter.py':
**Intent:** Implements the RecommendationFormatter class responsible for formatting recommendations into user-friendly outputs. This includes formatting for different display contexts and integration points.

**Design principles:**
- Consistent presentation of recommendations
- Support for different output formats (CLI, GUI, IDE)
- Clear presentation of rationale and context
- Actionable formatting with implementation suggestions

**Constraints:**
- Must support multiple output formats
- Should provide clear implementation guidance
- Must maintain consistency across different recommendation types
- Should optimize for user comprehension and action

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T18:45:00Z : Initial implementation of recommendation formatter

### Filename 'llm_integration.py':
**Intent:** Implements the LLMIntegrationService that leverages LLM capabilities to enhance recommendation generation. This includes using LLMs for suggestion refinement, code snippet generation, and explanation enhancement.

**Design principles:**
- Efficient integration with LLM services
- Context-aware prompt generation
- Result validation and filtering
- Fallback mechanisms for LLM unavailability

**Constraints:**
- Must use LLM services efficiently to minimize costs
- Should validate and sanitize LLM outputs
- Must handle LLM availability issues gracefully
- Should optimize prompt design for recommendation tasks

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-19T10:15:00Z : Initial implementation of LLM integration service

### Filename 'repository.py':
**Intent:** Implements the RecommendationRepository class responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing recommendations. This includes persistence, querying, and lifecycle management of recommendations.

**Design principles:**
- Efficient storage and retrieval of recommendations
- Support for filtering and sorting capabilities
- Transaction-based operations for data consistency
- Archiving strategies for older recommendations

**Constraints:**
- Must handle database operations efficiently
- Should implement proper caching for frequent queries
- Must maintain data consistency
- Should support recommendation lifecycle states

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T17:45:00Z : Initial implementation of recommendation repository

### Filename 'selector.py':
**Intent:** Implements the RecommendationSelector class that determines which recommendations should be presented to users at a given time. This includes prioritization, filtering based on context, and user preference application.

**Design principles:**
- Context-aware recommendation selection
- User preference-based filtering
- Avoidance of recommendation fatigue
- Support for different selection strategies

**Constraints:**
- Must respect user preferences and settings
- Should avoid overwhelming users with too many recommendations
- Must prioritize high-value recommendations
- Should adapt to user feedback patterns

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T20:15:00Z : Initial implementation of recommendation selector

### Filename 'strategy.py':
**Intent:** Implements various recommendation strategy classes using the strategy pattern. Each strategy specializes in generating a specific type of recommendation based on different analysis approaches.

**Design principles:**
- Clear strategy interface for all recommendation types
- Specialized strategies for different recommendation categories
- Composable strategies for complex recommendations
- Strategy selection based on context and configuration

**Constraints:**
- Must produce valuable, actionable recommendations
- Should be extensible for new recommendation types
- Must leverage available metadata effectively
- Strategies should be independently testable

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-19T09:30:00Z : Added documentation improvement strategies
- 2025-04-18T20:45:00Z : Initial implementation of code improvement strategies
