# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: recommendation_generator

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the Recommendation Generator component for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It systematically generates, manages, and applies actionable recommendations to fix inconsistencies between code and documentation. The component uses various strategies to generate appropriate fixes, potentially leveraging LLMs, and maintains a repository of recommendations with their lifecycle states. It follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns between recommendation generation, storage, formatting, and application.

### `__init__.py`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  Recommendation Generator package for the Documentation-Based Programming system.
  Generates recommendations for maintaining documentation consistency.
  
source_file_design_principles: |
  - Exports only the essential classes and functions needed by other components
  - Maintains a clean public API with implementation details hidden
  - Uses explicit imports rather than wildcard imports
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Must avoid circular imports
  - Should maintain backward compatibility for public interfaces

### `component.py`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  Implements the RecommendationGeneratorComponent class, the main entry point for
  the recommendation generation subsystem. It conforms to the Component protocol,
  initializes and manages its internal parts (repository, strategies, engine, etc.),
  registers strategies, and provides the public API for generating, formatting,
  applying, and managing recommendations based on detected inconsistencies.
  
source_file_design_principles: |
  - Conforms to the Component protocol (`src/dbp/core/component.py`).
  - Encapsulates the recommendation generation logic.
  - Declares dependencies ('database', 'consistency_analysis', 'llm_coordinator').
  - Initializes sub-components (repository, selector, engine, etc.) in `initialize`.
  - Registers concrete recommendation strategies.
  - Provides high-level methods delegating to internal services.
  - Manages its own initialization state.
  - Design Decision: Component Facade for Recommendations (2025-04-15)
    * Rationale: Groups recommendation logic into a single component.
    * Alternatives considered: Distributing logic across other components (less cohesive).
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Depends on core framework and other components ('database', 'consistency_analysis', 'llm_coordinator').
  - Requires all helper classes within `recommendation_generator` package.
  - Assumes configuration is available via InitializationContext.
  - Relies on placeholder implementations in strategies and LLM integration.
