# Bedrock Model Discovery Optimization Notes

## Performance Issues in Original Example

The original `model_discovery_example.py` was extremely slow due to:

1. **Multiple Redundant Region Scans**:
   - Forcing a rescan with `force_refresh=True` at startup
   - Separate scans for each demo function
   - Re-scanning regions for each model/client initialization
   - No reuse of cached data between functions

2. **Sequential API Calls**:
   - Creating and initializing a new client for each model
   - Redundant API calls to fetch the same data multiple times

3. **Inefficient Cache Usage**:
   - Deliberately bypassing caching to show "fresh" results
   - No sharing of data between functions

## Optimizations in `model_discovery_example_optimized.py`

1. **Single Region Scan**:
   - Performs a single initial scan and reuses the cached data
   - Only forces a refresh if cache is empty or invalid
   - Clear feedback about cache usage vs. API calls

2. **Data Sharing Between Functions**:
   - Uses a shared state dictionary to pass data between functions
   - Prevents multiple lookups of the same information

3. **Client Reuse**:
   - Stores clients in a dictionary keyed by model ID and profile ID
   - Reuses clients where possible, avoiding redundant initialization
   - Cleans up all clients at the end

4. **Smart Caching**:
   - Explicitly checks for cached data before making API calls
   - Logs when using cache vs. making API calls
   - Preserves cache across all demo functions

## Execution Time Comparison

The optimized example should run significantly faster because:

- It makes only 1 set of API calls to AWS regions instead of multiple redundant calls
- It reuses discovered data through the shared state dictionary
- It minimizes client initialization overhead

## Usage

Run the optimized example with:

```bash
python model_discovery_example_optimized.py
```

Compare with the original:

```bash
python model_discovery_example.py
```

## Key Implementation Differences

1. **Shared State Pattern**:
   ```python
   shared_state = {
       "model_discovery": model_discovery,
       "region_data": region_data,
       "project_models": project_models
   }
   ```
   Passed to all functions to avoid redundant data retrieval.

2. **Client Reuse**:
   ```python
   # Store clients for reuse
   model_clients = {}
   
   # Check for existing client
   client_key = f"{model_id}:{inference_profile_id}"
   client = model_clients.get(client_key)
   
   if not client:
       # Create new client only if needed
       client = BedrockBase(...)
       model_clients[client_key] = client
   ```

3. **Cache-First Approach**:
   ```python
   # Check if we need to perform an initial scan
   region_data = model_discovery.scan_all_regions()
   
   if not region_data.get("models", {}):
       # Only force refresh if cache is empty
       region_data = model_discovery.scan_all_regions(force_refresh=True)
   ```
