# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: langgraph

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements integration components for building agent workflows using the LangGraph framework with the DBP application's LLM subsystem. It provides the necessary abstractions for state management, graph construction, and node definitions required to create sophisticated, stateful agent workflows. The architecture enables defining complex agent behavior through a graph-based approach, supporting branching logic, tool integration, and stateful interactions while maintaining compatibility with both our custom LLM implementations and LangGraph's ecosystem.
