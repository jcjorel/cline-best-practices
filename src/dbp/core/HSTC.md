# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: core

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the fundamental component framework and core system utilities for the DBP application. It defines the Component architecture that serves as the backbone for the entire system, providing essential services for component lifecycle management, dependency injection, system initialization, error handling, and resource management. The core module enforces consistent patterns across all components while maintaining a minimalist approach that follows KISS principles - providing just enough structure to ensure proper system operation without unnecessary complexity.
