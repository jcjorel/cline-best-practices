# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: core

## Directory Purpose
The core directory implements the foundational infrastructure and patterns used throughout the Documentation-Based Programming system. It provides core abstractions including component lifecycle management, registry mechanisms, file access utilities, and system initialization. This module establishes the architectural scaffolding that other components build upon, ensuring consistency in how components are discovered, initialized, and interact with each other. The core functionality focuses on reliability, proper resource management, and clean shutdown procedures.
