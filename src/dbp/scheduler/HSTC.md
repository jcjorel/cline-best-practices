### Filename 'component.py':
**Intent:** Implements the SchedulerComponent class which provides a centralized background task scheduling service to the application. This component initializes and manages the task scheduling subsystem and exposes it to other components.

**Design principles:**
- Conforms to the Component protocol (src/dbp/core/component.py)
- Encapsulates the scheduling subsystem as a single component
- Provides thread-safe scheduling operations
- Implements configurable task prioritization
- Manages worker pools and execution environments

**Constraints:**
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent access from multiple components
- Should respect system resources specified in configuration
- Must implement proper task cleanup during shutdown
- Requires appropriate error handling for task failures

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-19T18:15:00Z : Added dependency injection support
- 2025-04-18T14:00:00Z : Initial creation of SchedulerComponent

### Filename 'controller.py':
**Intent:** Implements the SchedulerController class that provides the high-level control interface for the scheduling system. This includes task submission, cancellation, and monitoring operations.

**Design principles:**
- Clean API for task lifecycle management
- Support for task prioritization and resource allocation
- Comprehensive status reporting and monitoring
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access

**Constraints:**
- Must handle task dependencies correctly
- Should implement fair scheduling for tasks
- Must provide clear status information for tasks
- Should support task cancellation and modification

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T15:00:00Z : Initial implementation of scheduler controller

### Filename 'queue.py':
**Intent:** Implements the TaskQueue class that manages the queuing of scheduled tasks with support for prioritization, deduplication, and resource allocation.

**Design principles:**
- Efficient priority-based queuing
- Support for task deduplication and conflict resolution
- Thread-safe queue operations
- Optimized for high-throughput task processing

**Constraints:**
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent operations
- Should optimize for both throughput and fairness
- Must handle queue overflow scenarios
- Should support task promotion/demotion based on priority

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T14:30:00Z : Initial implementation of task queue

### Filename 'status.py':
**Intent:** Implements task status tracking and reporting functionality. This includes status definitions, state transitions, and reporting interfaces for task execution.

**Design principles:**
- Comprehensive task state model
- Atomic state transitions
- Detailed status reporting
- Historical execution information

**Constraints:**
- Must handle state transitions atomically
- Should provide detailed status information
- Must track execution history for debugging
- Should optimize for frequent status updates

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T16:15:00Z : Initial implementation of task status tracking

### Filename 'worker.py':
**Intent:** Implements the TaskWorker class responsible for executing scheduled tasks. This includes task initialization, execution, resource management, and result handling.

**Design principles:**
- Isolated task execution environments
- Resource usage monitoring and limits
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Support for different execution backends

**Constraints:**
- Must isolate task execution for stability
- Should limit resource usage per task
- Must handle task failures without affecting the worker
- Should support different task execution modes

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T15:45:00Z : Initial implementation of task worker
