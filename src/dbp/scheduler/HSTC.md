# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: scheduler

## Directory Purpose
The scheduler directory implements a background task scheduling system for the Documentation-Based Programming platform. It provides mechanisms for scheduling periodic tasks, deferred operations, and one-time jobs that operate on documentation and code. This component supports parallel execution, prioritization, and resource management to ensure efficient background processing without impacting user-facing operations. The scheduler is designed for reliability with task persistence, error handling, and automatic recovery from failures.
