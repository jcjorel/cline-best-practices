### Filename 'component.py':
**Intent:** Implements the LLMCoordinatorComponent class, the main entry point for the LLM coordination subsystem within the DBP application framework. It conforms to the Component protocol, initializes all necessary sub-components (request handler, coordinator LLM, tool registry, job manager, response formatter), registers internal tools, and provides the primary interface (`process_request`) for handling coordinated LLM tasks.

**Design principles:**
- Conforms to the Component protocol (`src/dbp/core/component.py`).
- Encapsulates the entire LLM coordination logic.
- Declares dependencies on other components (e.g., background_scheduler, config).
- Initializes and wires together internal sub-components during the `initialize` phase.
- Registers the defined internal LLM tools with the `ToolRegistry`.
- Provides a high-level `process_request` method that orchestrates the flow.
- Handles component shutdown gracefully.
- Design Decision: Component Facade for LLM Coordination (2025-04-15)
  * Rationale: Presents the complex LLM coordination logic as a single, manageable component.
  * Alternatives considered: Exposing individual coordinator parts (more complex integration).

**Constraints:**
- Depends on the core component framework and other system components.
- Requires all sub-components (`RequestHandler`, `CoordinatorLLM`, etc.) to be implemented.
- Assumes configuration for the coordinator is available via InitializationContext.
- Placeholder logic exists for the `InternalToolExecutionEngine` and actual tool execution.

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-20T01:33:21Z : Completed dependency injection refactoring
  * Removed dependencies property
  * Made dependencies parameter required in initialize method
  * Removed conditional logic for backwards compatibility
- 2025-04-20T00:25:54Z : Added dependency injection support
  * Updated initialize() method to accept dependencies parameter
  * Added dependency validation for config_manager component
  * Enhanced method documentation for dependency injection pattern
- 2025-04-17T23:34:30Z : Updated to use strongly-typed configuration
  * Updated initialize() method signature to use InitializationContext
  * Refactored configuration access to use type-safe get_typed_config() method
  * Added support for strongly-typed configuration in sub-components
  * Improved type safety for configuration access
- 2025-04-16T17:33:57Z : Fixed component initialization configuration access
  * Modified initialize method to properly access configuration through the config_manager component
  * Updated configuration passing to sub-components

### Filename 'coordinator_llm.py':
**Intent:** Implements the CoordinatorLLM class that interacts with the underlying LLM to determine which internal tools to execute for a given request. It acts as the "brain" of the coordination system, analyzing requests and planning tool executions.

**Design principles:**
- LLM-driven coordination of tool execution
- Clean separation of concerns for request analysis
- Prompt-based decision making for tool selection
- Error handling for LLM interaction failures

**Constraints:**
- Depends on available LLM models and their capabilities
- Must handle LLM failures gracefully
- Should optimize prompt design for effective tool selection

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-16T14:30:00Z : Initial implementation of CoordinatorLLM class

### Filename 'data_models.py':
**Intent:** Defines the data models and data structures used throughout the LLM coordination subsystem, ensuring consistent data representation and type safety across components.

**Design principles:**
- Strong typing for all coordinator data structures
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- Clear separation of request, response, and job models
- Immutable models where appropriate for thread safety

**Constraints:**
- Must support serialization for persistence
- Should be backward compatible when evolving schemas
- Models should validate inputs to prevent downstream errors

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-16T13:15:00Z : Initial creation of LLM coordinator data models

### Filename 'job_manager.py':
**Intent:** Implements the JobManager class responsible for scheduling, tracking, and executing internal tool jobs. It manages the lifecycle of jobs from creation to completion, including error handling and result collection.

**Design principles:**
- Asynchronous job execution with synchronous API facade
- Thread-safe job tracking with atomic operations
- Graceful handling of job failures and timeouts
- Support for job prioritization and concurrency control

**Constraints:**
- Must support parallel job execution for efficiency
- Should handle task timeouts and cancellation
- Must ensure thread safety for concurrent access

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-16T15:20:00Z : Initial implementation of JobManager

### Filename 'request_handler.py':
**Intent:** Implements the RequestHandler class that validates, normalizes, and prepares incoming coordinator requests. It ensures requests are properly formatted and contain all required information before passing them to the coordinator.

**Design principles:**
- Strong input validation for all requests
- Request normalization to standardize formats
- Context enrichment with metadata for coordinators
- Clear error reporting for validation failures

**Constraints:**
- Must validate requests exhaustively to prevent errors downstream
- Should handle different request formats gracefully
- Must maintain backward compatibility for API consumers

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-16T14:00:00Z : Initial implementation of RequestHandler

### Filename 'response_formatter.py':
**Intent:** Implements the ResponseFormatter class responsible for formatting the final response from tool execution results. It combines multiple job results into a coherent response structure with appropriate formatting.

**Design principles:**
- Consistent response structure across different requests
- Error normalization into standardized formats
- Support for various output formats (JSON, text, structured)
- Context-aware formatting based on request type

**Constraints:**
- Must handle both successful and error responses
- Should provide detailed context for errors
- Must maintain backward compatibility for API consumers

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-16T17:00:00Z : Initial implementation of ResponseFormatter

### Filename 'tool_registry.py':
**Intent:** Implements the ToolRegistry class that manages the registration and lookup of internal tools available to the coordinator. It provides a mechanism for discovering tools and dispatching requests to the appropriate tool implementation.

**Design principles:**
- Simple registration interface for tools
- Name-based tool lookup with validation
- Support for tool metadata and documentation
- Clear error handling for missing tools

**Constraints:**
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent registrations
- Should validate tool interfaces at registration time
- Must prevent duplicate registrations with clear errors

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-16T15:45:00Z : Initial implementation of ToolRegistry
