# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: llm_coordinator

## Directory Purpose
The llm_coordinator directory implements a component responsible for coordinating interactions with large language models across the system. It manages the lifecycle of LLM requests, distributes tasks to appropriate LLM clients, and handles responses in a unified manner. This component acts as a central orchestrator for all LLM operations, providing a consistent interface for other system components while abstracting away the complexities of model selection, request formatting, and response parsing.
