# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: memory_cache

## Directory Purpose
The memory_cache directory implements an in-memory caching system for document analysis results, parsed documentation, and other frequently accessed data. It provides efficient storage, retrieval, and indexing mechanisms with configurable eviction strategies to optimize memory usage. This component serves as a performance enhancement layer that reduces repeated processing of the same documents and analysis results, while maintaining synchronization with the underlying file system to ensure cache validity when documents are modified.
