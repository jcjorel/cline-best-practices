### Filename 'component.py':
**Intent:** Implements the MemoryCacheComponent class that provides a centralized in-memory caching service to the application. This component initializes and manages the memory cache subsystem and exposes it to other components.

**Design principles:**
- Conforms to the Component protocol (src/dbp/core/component.py)
- Encapsulates the memory cache subsystem as a single component
- Provides thread-safe caching operations for concurrent access
- Implements configurable cache limits and eviction policies
- Maintains cache statistics for monitoring and optimization

**Constraints:**
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent access from multiple components
- Should respect memory limits specified in configuration
- Must implement proper cleanup during shutdown
- Requires appropriate dependency declaration for components that use it

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-19T15:30:00Z : Added dependency injection support
- 2025-04-18T09:45:00Z : Initial creation of MemoryCacheComponent

### Filename 'eviction.py':
**Intent:** Implements various cache eviction policies to optimize memory usage and performance. Provides algorithms to determine which items should be removed when the cache reaches capacity limits.

**Design principles:**
- Modular design with strategy pattern for different eviction algorithms
- Configurable policies based on application needs
- Performance-optimized implementations for fast decision making
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access

**Constraints:**
- Must be efficient to not impact cache performance
- Should support multiple eviction strategies (LRU, TTL, etc.)
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent access

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-17T14:20:00Z : Implemented LRU and TTL eviction strategies
- 2025-04-17T14:00:00Z : Initial creation of eviction policy framework

### Filename 'index_manager.py':
**Intent:** Implements the IndexManager class that provides indexing capabilities for the memory cache. This enables fast lookups based on different criteria beyond the primary cache key.

**Design principles:**
- Efficient index structures for fast lookup operations
- Support for multiple index types (hash, sorted, etc.)
- Thread-safe index operations for concurrent access
- Automatic index maintenance as cache entries change

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain index consistency with cache state
- Should minimize memory overhead of indices
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent operations
- Should handle index rebuild operations efficiently

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-17T16:30:00Z : Added sorted index implementation
- 2025-04-17T15:45:00Z : Initial creation of index manager

### Filename 'interface.py':
**Intent:** Defines the public interface for the memory cache system, including the CacheInterface abstract class and related data models. This provides a clean API for other components to interact with the cache.

**Design principles:**
- Clean and minimal API design for cache operations
- Strong typing for all interface methods
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations

**Constraints:**
- Must be stable for dependent components
- Should support both simple and advanced use cases
- Must define clear error conditions and handling

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-17T13:30:00Z : Initial creation of memory cache interface

### Filename 'query.py':
**Intent:** Implements query capabilities for the memory cache to support complex data retrieval operations beyond simple key-value lookups. Supports filtering, sorting, and aggregation operations.

**Design principles:**
- Flexible query language for advanced cache searches
- Optimized query execution using available indices
- Support for complex filtering conditions
- Result pagination for large result sets

**Constraints:**
- Must leverage indexes when available for performance
- Should handle complex query failures gracefully
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent query execution

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-17T18:15:00Z : Added support for complex filtering conditions
- 2025-04-17T17:45:00Z : Initial implementation of query capabilities

### Filename 'storage.py':
**Intent:** Implements the core storage mechanism for the memory cache, handling the actual data storage, retrieval, and management of cache entries. Provides the foundation for all cache operations.

**Design principles:**
- Efficient data structures for fast access operations
- Thread-safe storage implementation
- Support for different value types and serialization
- Memory-optimized storage with minimal overhead

**Constraints:**
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent operations
- Should optimize for memory efficiency
- Must handle item expiration and removal
- Should support various value types efficiently

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-17T15:00:00Z : Added support for binary data storage
- 2025-04-17T14:30:00Z : Initial implementation of memory storage

### Filename 'synchronizer.py':
**Intent:** Implements mechanisms to synchronize cache state with external data sources or other cache instances. Provides functionality for cache warming, periodic refresh, and consistency maintenance.

**Design principles:**
- Configurable synchronization strategies
- Background synchronization to minimize performance impact
- Support for different synchronization sources
- Conflict resolution for concurrent updates

**Constraints:**
- Must not block normal cache operations
- Should handle synchronization failures gracefully
- Must track synchronization status for monitoring
- Should optimize network usage for remote synchronization

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-17T19:00:00Z : Added background synchronization capabilities
- 2025-04-17T18:30:00Z : Initial implementation of cache synchronizer
