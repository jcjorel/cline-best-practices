# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: internal_tools

## Directory Purpose
The internal_tools directory implements utility components and services for internal system operations that are not directly exposed to users. It provides a set of specialized tools for common tasks like file access, prompt management, LLM request execution, and context assembly. These tools are designed to be used by other system components to perform operations that require specialized handling of documentation files, context management, and LLM interactions. The module follows a modular design with clear interfaces and focused responsibilities.
