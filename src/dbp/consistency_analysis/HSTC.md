# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: consistency_analysis

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the Consistency Analysis component for the Documentation-Based Programming system. It provides functionality to detect and analyze inconsistencies between code and documentation artifacts using a rule-based engine and specialized analyzers. The component employs a registry pattern to manage various analyzers that implement different consistency checking rules, stores detected inconsistencies in a repository, and generates comprehensive reports. It serves as a foundational component for maintaining codebase-documentation alignment.

### `component.py`
```yaml
source_file_intent: |
  Implements the ConsistencyAnalysisComponent class, the main entry point for the
  consistency analysis subsystem. It conforms to the Component protocol, initializes
  and manages the lifecycle of its internal parts (repository, registry, engine,
  analyzers, reporter), registers the analyzers, and provides the public API for
  running analyses and managing inconsistency records.
  
source_file_design_principles: |
  - Conforms to the Component protocol (`src/dbp/core/component.py`).
  - Encapsulates the entire consistency analysis logic.
  - Declares dependencies on other components ('database', 'doc_relationships', 'metadata_extraction').
  - Initializes sub-components (repository, registry, engine, etc.) in `initialize`.
  - Registers concrete analyzer implementations with the `AnalysisRegistry`.
  - Provides high-level methods for triggering different analysis scopes.
  - Manages its own initialization state.
  - Design Decision: Component Facade for Consistency Analysis (2025-04-15)
    * Rationale: Presents the consistency analysis subsystem as a single component.
    * Alternatives considered: Exposing engine/registry directly (more complex).
  
source_file_constraints: |
  - Depends on the core component framework and other system components.
  - Requires all helper classes within the `consistency_analysis` package.
  - Assumes configuration is available via InitializationContext.
  - Relies on placeholder implementations within the concrete analyzers.
