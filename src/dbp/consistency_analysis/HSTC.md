# Hierarchical Semantic Tree Context: consistency_analysis

## Directory Purpose
This directory implements the consistency analysis subsystem of the DBP system, responsible for detecting inconsistencies between code and documentation. It provides components for analyzing code-documentation alignment, identifying potential issues, assessing their impact, and generating comprehensive reports. The system uses a repository pattern for storing analysis results and a registry for tracking consistency rules and validation strategies. The impact analyzer enables understanding how documentation changes affect code quality and vice versa.
