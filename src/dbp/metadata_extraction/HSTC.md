### Filename 'component.py':
**Intent:** Implements the MetadataExtractionComponent class which coordinates the extraction of metadata from project files using LLM models. This component serves as the entry point for metadata extraction operations within the DBP system.

**Design principles:**
- Conforms to the Component protocol (src/dbp/core/component.py)
- Coordinates metadata extraction workflows
- Delegates the actual extraction work to specialized services
- Manages extraction process lifecycle
- Provides a clean interface for other components

**Constraints:**
- Depends on file access and database components
- Must handle extraction errors gracefully
- Should respect rate limits for LLM API calls
- Requires appropriate configuration for extraction rules

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-19T16:45:00Z : Added dependency injection support
- 2025-04-18T10:30:00Z : Initial creation of MetadataExtractionComponent

### Filename 'bedrock_client.py':
**Intent:** Provides a specialized client for interacting with AWS Bedrock models specifically for metadata extraction tasks. This client handles the communication with AWS Bedrock for extracting structured metadata from file content.

**Design principles:**
- Optimized prompts for metadata extraction
- Efficient token usage to minimize costs
- Robust error handling for API interactions
- Specialized response parsing for metadata

**Constraints:**
- Requires AWS credentials and permissions
- Must handle model-specific formatting requirements
- Should implement retry logic for transient failures
- Must respect API rate limits

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T11:15:00Z : Initial implementation of Bedrock client for metadata extraction

### Filename 'data_structures.py':
**Intent:** Defines the data structures and models used throughout the metadata extraction subsystem. These structures represent extracted metadata, extraction rules, and processing results.

**Design principles:**
- Strong typing for all metadata structures
- Validation rules for extracted data
- Serialization support for persistence
- Clear separation of different metadata types

**Constraints:**
- Must support versioning for schema evolution
- Should be efficient for frequent serialization
- Must define clear validation rules

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T10:45:00Z : Initial creation of metadata data structures

### Filename 'database_writer.py':
**Intent:** Implements the DatabaseWriter class responsible for persisting extracted metadata to the database. This component handles the transformation of extracted metadata into database models and manages the storage operations.

**Design principles:**
- Transaction-based batch writing for performance
- Conflict resolution for duplicate entries
- Version tracking for metadata evolution
- Error handling with automatic retries

**Constraints:**
- Must handle database connection issues gracefully
- Should implement efficient batch operations
- Must maintain data consistency during failures
- Should track metadata provenance

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T14:30:00Z : Initial implementation of database writer

### Filename 'response_parser.py':
**Intent:** Implements the ResponseParser class that processes raw LLM responses and extracts structured metadata according to defined schemas. This component transforms unstructured or semi-structured LLM outputs into well-defined metadata objects.

**Design principles:**
- Robust parsing with error recovery
- Schema-based validation of extracted data
- Graceful handling of unexpected response formats
- Normalization of extracted values

**Constraints:**
- Must handle various response formats from different LLMs
- Should extract maximum value even from partial responses
- Must validate extracted data against schemas
- Should normalize values for consistency

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T13:00:00Z : Initial implementation of response parser

### Filename 'result_processor.py':
**Intent:** Implements the ResultProcessor class that performs post-processing on extracted metadata, including validation, enrichment, correlation, and transformation for downstream use.

**Design principles:**
- Pipeline-based processing stages
- Pluggable processors for different metadata types
- Validation at each processing stage
- Audit trail for processing operations

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain data integrity during processing
- Should handle processing failures gracefully
- Must support extensible processing pipeline
- Should optimize for bulk processing performance

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T15:45:00Z : Initial implementation of result processor

### Filename 'service.py':
**Intent:** Implements the MetadataExtractionService class that provides the core functionality for extracting metadata from files. This service coordinates the extraction workflow from file content to processed metadata.

**Design principles:**
- Clear separation of concerns in extraction pipeline
- Support for different extraction strategies
- Concurrent extraction for performance
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

**Constraints:**
- Must handle various file types and content formats
- Should implement throttling for API rate limits
- Must track extraction status for reporting
- Should optimize for extraction performance

**Change History:**
- 2025-04-18T12:15:00Z : Initial implementation of extraction service
